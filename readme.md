Introduction: 

calibre is a powerful and easy to use e-book manager. 

Users say itâ€™s outstanding and a must-have. 

Itâ€™ll allow you to do nearly everything and it takes things a step beyond normal e-book software. 

Itâ€™s also completely free and open source.

What's the problem?

Calibreâ€™s metadata.db can get messy over time due to:

    Inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., J.K. Rowling vs Rowling, J. K.)

    Duplicate or incomplete metadata

    Incorrect formats or typos

    Non-standard tags or genres

Manually fixing this at scale is tedious. 

This is where machine learning (ML) can assist by detecting patterns, 
making predictions, and suggesting or automating fixes.

# Core Idea: Using ML for Metadata Cleanup

The approach can be broken down into key ML applications:
1. Author Name Normalization

    Model Type: Clustering (e.g., DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) + Named Entity Recognition (NER)

    Goal: Group similar author names and normalize to a canonical form

    Example: Cluster Rowling, J.K. / J.K. Rowling / Joanne Rowling as one entity

2. Genre/Tag Standardization

    Model Type: NLP Classification (e.g., using BERT or Logistic Regression)

    Goal: Predict the correct genre based on title, description, or content

    Data Input: Book title, summary, or even EPUB/MOBI text

    Output: Standardized genre labels (e.g., "Science Fiction", "Biography")

3. Duplicate Detection

    Model Type: Record linkage (fuzzy matching, cosine similarity, TF-IDF)

    Goal: Find books that are likely duplicates based on title + author + publication year

4. Filling in Missing Fields

    Model Type: Language Models or k-Nearest Neighbors

    Goal: Predict missing values like series name or publisher from similar books

# How To Apply This Practically

## Step 1: Extract Data from metadata.db

Calibre uses SQLite, so you can query it like this:

sqlite3 metadata.db "SELECT title, authors, tags, series_index, pubdate, publisher FROM books;"

Use Python's sqlite3 or pandas.read_sql_query() to pull it into a dataframe.

## Step 2: Clean and Prepare

    Strip whitespace

    Normalize case

    Tokenize names and titles

    Remove stopwords or punctuation if needed

## Step 3: Build and Train Models

* Author Clustering

* Genre Prediction 

* Duplicate Detection

## Step 4: Suggest Fixes or Apply Them

Create a CSV with:

    Suggested canonical author names

    Suggested genres

    Detected duplicates

    Missing fields with model predictions

Review manually or use Calibre's calibredb CLI to apply changes.

# Visualization Aids

You can use graphs to assist:

    Clustering result plots (e.g., 2D PCA projection of author clusters)

    Genre frequency histograms

    Missing data heatmaps

    Similarity matrices for duplicates

# Real-World Application Workflow

    Export metadata.db â†’ DataFrame

    Run ML scripts (clean, cluster, predict)

    Generate a CSV or GUI interface for review

    Re-import cleaned data using Calibreâ€™s APIs or calibredb

# Bonus Ideas

    Transformers for more nuanced title/genre understanding

    Fine-tune on your library if you have enough labeled examples

    Automate updates via scheduled scripts if new books are added frequently

# Structure

Follows TDSP principles: modular code, notebooks, documentation, reproducible data pipeline.
