# TDSP Project Structure: Calibre Metadata Cleanup with Machine Learning

This document outlines how the **Calibre ML Cleanup** project adheres to the principles of the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP)**. The TDSP provides a structured lifecycle and folder organization for collaborative, scalable, and reproducible data science projects.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To automate the cleanup and enrichment of Calibre's `metadata.db` using machine learning techniques. This includes:
- Normalizing author names
- Predicting consistent genres and tags
- Detecting duplicates
- Filling in missing metadata fields

**Target Users:**  
Anyone managing large Calibre libraries who needs intelligent metadata correction and consistency.

**Primary Tools:**  
Python, SQLite, scikit-learn, pandas, fuzzywuzzy, HuggingFace Transformers (optional)
