  "description": "<p>The Martian Chronicles, a seminal work in Ray Bradbury's career, whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage, is available from Simon &amp; Schuster for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>In The Martian Chronicles, Ray Bradbury, America\u2019s preeminent storyteller, imagines a place of hope, dreams, and metaphor\u2014 of crystal pillars and fossil seas\u2014where a fine dust settles on the great empty cities of a vanished, devastated civilization. Earthmen conquer Mars and then are conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. In this classic work of fiction, Bradbury exposes our ambitions, weaknesses, and ignorance in a strange and breathtaking world where man does not belong.</p>"
