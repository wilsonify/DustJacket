  "description": "<div>\n<p>\u201cHilarious, always inventive, this is a book for all, especially uptight English teachers, bardolaters, and ministerial students.\u201d \u2014Dallas Morning NewsFool\u2014the bawdy and outrageous New York Times bestseller from the unstoppable Christopher Moore\u2014is a hilarious new take on William Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear\u2026as seen through the eyes of the foolish liege\u2019s clownish jester, Pocket. A rousing tale of \u201cgratuitous shagging, murder, spanking, maiming, treason, and heretofore unexplored heights of vulgarity and profanity,\u201d Fool joins Moore\u2019s own Lamb, Fluke, The Stupidest Angel, and You Suck! as modern masterworks of satiric wit and sublimely twisted genius, prompting Carl Hiassen to declare Christopher Moore \u201ca very sick man, in the very best sense of the word.\u201d</p></div>"
