  "description": "<p>It was the worst day of Tim Blake's life. His seventeen-year-old daughter, Sydney, was staying with him while she worked a summer job at the Just Inn Time hotel - father-daughter time to help with the after-effects of his divorce. Syd didn't arrive home at her usual time. Then, worryingly, she didn't answer her phone. And when the people at the Just Inn Time told him they'd no Sydney Blake working at the hotel, he was plunged into the abyss every parent dreads most. Where had she been every day, if not working at the Just Inn Time...? To find his daughter Tim must discover who she really was, and what could have made her step out of her own life without leaving a trace.</p>"
