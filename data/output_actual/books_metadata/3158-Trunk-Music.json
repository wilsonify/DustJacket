  "description": "<p>\"TERRIFIC.\"--The New York Times When B-grade L.A. movie producer Tony Aliso is found stuffed into the trunk of his Rolls Royce, all signs point to \"trunk music\"?a mob hit. Detective Harry Bosch, just back from an \"involuntary stress leave,\" is not so sure. And when he finds the money trail, he follows it...all the way to Vegas. \"A SURE BET.\"--People Seems this Tony had his share of enemies, and in no time, so does Harry: Vegas thugs, LAPD's organized crime unit, a smarmy internal affairs investigator and, of course, Tony's killers. Everyone wants a piece of Harry. And somehow, they've found just the way to get it. . .  \"COMPELLING.\"--The Washington Post Turns out that just before his death, Tony was seen at a Vegas poker table with one Eleanor Wish?ex-FBI agent, ex-convict . . . and ex-love of Harry's life. Now it's time for Harry to keep his cards close to the table--and his enemies even closer before it's time to face the TRUNK MUSIC</p>"
