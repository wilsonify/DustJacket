  "description": "<p>\"JUST ONE LOOK: Grace Lawson is living a happy, straightforward life in the suburbs with her husband, Jack, and two young children. But that security is about to come to a brutal end. When Grace picks up a set of holiday snaps, among them is one shot that doesn't fit: a faded image of a life that Grace doesn't recognise and of her husband as she never knew him. Within twelve hours, Jack has disappeared, a brutal hitman is stalking her family and the safe world she knows has been turned upside down. And all Grace can see is that the past is coming back to haunt the present and people are getting hurt. THE INNOCENT: Matt Hunter's life has already been blown apart once. A fight, a friend in trouble, and the dull crack of someone's skull on the concrete cost him four years in jail, and a small sliver of his soul. When Matt got out he rebuilt his life, getting a job as a lawyer and falling in love with a beautiful woman. The break in the road seemed only to have made him a stronger person. But now someone is following him, and Matt realises that his new existence is under threat. Suddenly Matt can't trust anybody - least of all those he loves. PROMISE ME: The phone rings at 2am, a young frightened girl who has called the one adult who promised to help her if she ever got into any trouble - Myron Bolitar. He races down to pick up her up from a cold street corner and take her back to safety. But young Aimee Biel persuades him to drop her at an address in the suburbs. It's a mistake Myron lives to regret, as Aimee's wave from a darkened porch is the last time anyone will see her. Driven by guilt Myron gets involved in the search, a decision that will mean facing his past. Myron must choose once and for all who he is and what he will stand up for if he is to have any hope of rescuing both Aimee and himself.</p>\n\n<p>\" - product description.</p>"
