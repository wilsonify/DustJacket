  "description": "<p>With factions on board, and multiple enemies to contend with, only the most careful navigation will save them. As he sails away from Port Jackson, Captain Jack Aubrey feels nothing but relief at leaving the penal colony and its inhabitants far behind. But, unknown to him, hidden among his crew is one Clarissa Oakes. With Britain at war on two fronts, with both America and France, Aubrey\u2019s orders are to make for the Sandwich Islands and intervene in the conflict there.  How much trouble can one woman cause?  \u2018One moment you laugh out loud at comedy rooted in character, and the next, storming adventure or danger grips you by the throat . . . good writing allied to must-read-on storytelling.\u2019SHAUN USHER, Daily Mail \u2018Thank God for Patrick O\u2019Brian. His genius illuminates the literature of the English language, and lightens the lives of those who read him.\u2019KEVIN MYERS, Irish Times</p>"
