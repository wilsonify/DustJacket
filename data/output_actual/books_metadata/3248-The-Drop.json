  "description": "<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2011</strong>: With his retirement looming, LAPD's Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch takes on two seemingly unrelated cases. The first is a botched DNA test from a 1989 rape and murder, which has been pinned on a convicted rapist who was only eight years old at the time of the crime. Harry's pursuit of that case is interrupted by the apparent suicide of a councilman's son. A former police chief and no fan of Harry's, the councilman insists that Harry investigate his son's death. In pursuit of the truth, and an elusive killer, Bosch and his partner uncover secrets and a political conspiracy deep within the police department. Connelly's aging hero is a flawed, haunted, and unforgettable character; his creator is a master craftsman. <em>--Neal Thompson</em><br /></p><h3>Review</h3><p>PRAISE FOR <em>THE REVERSAL</em>:<br /></p><p>\"Each of his books is so much more than the sum of its parts....Connelly writes true-to-life fiction about true crime.
