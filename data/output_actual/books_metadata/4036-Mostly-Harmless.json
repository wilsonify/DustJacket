  "description": "<div>\n<p><strong>Now celebrating the 42nd anniversary of</strong> The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, <strong>soon to be a Hulu original series!</strong> ** </p>\n<p>\u201cHitchhiker fans rejoice! . . . [Here\u2019s] more of the same zany nonsensical mayhem.\u201d\u2014**The New York Times Book Review </p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to get disheartened when your planet has been blown up and the woman you love has vanished due to a misunderstanding about space/time. However, instead of being disheartened, Arthur Dent makes the terrible mistake of starting to enjoy life a bit\u2014and immediately all hell breaks loose. </p>\n<p>Hell takes a number of forms: there\u2019s the standard Ford Prefect version, in the shape of an all-new edition of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and a totally unexpected manifestation in the form of a teenage girl who startles Arthur Dent by being his daughter when he didn\u2019t even know he had one. </p>\n<p>Can Arthur save the Earth from total multidimensional obliteration? Can he save the Guide from a hostile alien takeover? Can he save his daughter, Random, from herself? Of course not. He never works out exactly what is going on. Will you? </p>\n<p><strong>\u201cDouglas Adams is a terrific satirist. . . . He is anything but harmless.\u201d\u2014</strong> The Washington Post Book World</p></div>"
