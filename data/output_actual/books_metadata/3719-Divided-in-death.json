  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: Killing was too good for him. She wanted him to beg and plead like the gutter rat he wasshe wanted him to bleed and screamonly then the bastard could die. A slow, withering, agonizing death. Nobody, nobody cheated on Reva Ewing.' Roarke's security specialist Reva Ewing is the prime suspect in a double homicide - accused of killing her adulterous husband and his lover - the woman Reva thought was her best friend. But despite having every reason for wanting both of them dead, Reva protests her innocence and Lieutenant Eve Dallas believes her. At the time of the murders, Reva's husband's computer system was also sabotaged. To Roarke, it's the computer attack that poses the real threat. Roarke Industries have been working on a top secret government contract to develop a program that would shield against a new breed of hackers. The Doomsday Group are techno-terrorists who attack systems, steal data, and corrupt computer units on a large scale - and they kill anyone who gets too close."
