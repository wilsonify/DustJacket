  "description": "<div><p><strong>The true account of the 1979 rescue of six American hostages from Iran</strong><br></p><p>On November 4, 1979, Iranian militants stormed the American embassy in Tehran and captured dozens of American hostages, sparking a 444-day ordeal and a quake in global politics still reverberating today. But there is a little-known drama connected to the crisis: six Americans escaped. And a top-level CIA officer named Antonio Mendez devised an ingenious yet incredibly risky plan to rescue them before they were detected.<br></p><p>Disguising himself as a Hollywood producer, and supported by a cast of expert forgers, deep cover CIA operatives, foreign agents, and Hollywood special effects artists, Mendez traveled to Tehran under the guise of scouting locations for a fake science fiction film called <em>Argo</em>. While pretending to find the perfect film backdrops, Mendez and a colleague succeeded in contacting the escapees, and smuggling them out of Iran.<br></p><p>Antonio Mendez finally details the extraordinarily complex and dangerous operation he led more than three decades ago. A riveting story of secret identities and international intrigue, Argo is the gripping account of the history-making collusion between Hollywood and high-stakes espionage.\u00a0<br></p><h3>Review</h3><p>\u201cThis is an amazing and dramatic story of intrigue and deception set against the backdrop of</p><p>international tension.\u201d<br>\u2014<em>Booklist\u00a0<br></em></p><p>\u201cFresh and engaging\u2026A solid choice for fans of thrillers and international intrigue.\u201d \u00a0<br>\u2014<em>Kirkus\u00a0<br></em></p><p>\u201c[A] fast-paced account of a 1979 rescue operation during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979\u20131981\u2026</p><p>Details of this dangerous operation inject strong suspense and excitement into the closing chapters.\u201d \u00a0<br>\u2014<em>Publishers Weekly<br></em></p><p>\u201cOne of the most daring and courageous clandestine operations during my career involved efforts to rescue Americans taken hostage in Tehran after our embassy was seized on November 4, 1979. Six Americans managed to escape the U.S. compound and flee to the Canadian embassy, where they were hidden. A very brave CIA officer, Tony Mendez, using commercial cover, entered Iran with false identities for the six and, using techniques that ought to remain secret so they can be used again, managed to get them out of Iran.\u201d \u00a0<br>\u2014Robert M. Gates, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and former U.S. Secretary of Defense, in his book <em>From the Shadows<br></em></p><p>\u201cThis is a fascinating story about how Tony Mendez and the CIA used a bit of technical expertise and a lot of daring and courage to rescue American hostages in Iran. Tony is emblematic of the extraordinary men and women of CIA. Most of their stories cannot be told\u2014but fortunately, in ARGO, Tony has been able to lift the veil of secrecy\u2014just a bit.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u2014George J.

Hiding in plain sight, they rescue six virtual hostages under the eyes of their captors, a covert operation seemingly devised in Central Casting. Now their story can be told \u2013 and it makes for one hell of read.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u2014Peter Earnest, retired CIA officer and Executive Director, International Spy Museum<br></p><p>\u201cThis true spy story has it all: guile, audacity, and bravery in a struggle with a fanatic and lethal enemy, a crucial role played by a loyal ally, and a marvelous conspiracy with Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u2014R.

His work saved my neck on numerous occasions. I laugh quietly to myself when I watch Hollywood\u2019s version of disguise technology in today\u2019s spy movies\u2014because Tony did it better. What he did in the Argo operation was spine-tingling espionage at its very best.\u201d \u00a0<br>\u2014James M.
