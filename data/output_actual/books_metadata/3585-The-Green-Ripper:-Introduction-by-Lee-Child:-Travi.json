  "description": "<p>'MacDonald had a huge influence on me . . . Reacher is like a fully detached version of Travis McGee' LEE CHILD Travis McGee isn\u2019t your typical knight in shining armour. He only works when his cash runs out, and his rule is simple: He\u2019ll help you find whatever was taken from you, as long as he can keep half. Travis McGee has known his share of beautiful girls, but true love always passed him by \u2013 until Gretel. But suddenly, the woman who stole his heart dies of an unidentified illness. Convinced that she has been murdered, McGee finds himself pursuing a less-than-noble cause: revenge. Obsessed with his crusade, he becomes more and more unhinged. He has spent his life saving other people, but now he\u2019ll need to find the strength to save himself \u2013 before he loses his mind. First published in 1979, The Green Ripper was the winner of the National Book Award. This edition features an introduction by Lee Child.</p>\n\n<p>JOHN D.
