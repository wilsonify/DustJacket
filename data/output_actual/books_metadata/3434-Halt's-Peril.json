  "description": "<h3>From</h3><p>Continuing the story line begun in The Kings of Clonmel (2010), book 9 of the Ranger\u2019s Apprentice series sends Halt, Will, and Horace back on the trail of the same vicious, thieving outlaws. When a poisoned arrow takes Halt out of his senses and soon threatens his life, his younger comrades must take the lead to save him and continue their mission. A fine addition to a popular series, this volume sends the three main characters into adventures that they can survive only by relying on one other. Series fans will enjoy the dialogue and camaraderie as much as the action. Grades 5-8. --Carolyn Phelan </p><h3>Product Description</h3><p>The renegade outlaw group known as the Outsiders may have been chased from Clonmel, but not before killing Halt's only brother. Now Rangers Halt and Will, along with the young warrior Horace, are in pursuit. The Outsiders have done an effective job of dividing the kingdom into factions and are looking to overtake Araluen. It will take every bit of skill and cunning for the Rangers to survive. Some may not be so lucky. </p><p>The international bestselling Ranger's Apprentice series turns up the tension in John Flanagan's latest epic of battles and bravery.</p>"
