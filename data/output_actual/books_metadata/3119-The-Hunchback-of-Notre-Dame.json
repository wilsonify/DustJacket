But someone steps forward to help\u2014the beautiful gypsy Esmeralda, whose single act of kindness fills Quasimodo with love. Can the hunchback save the lovely gypsy from Frollo\u2019s evil plan, or will they all perish in the shadows of Notre Dame?An epic tale of beauty and sadness, The Hunchback of Notre Dame portrays the sufferings of humanity with compassion and power.Isabel Roche teaches French language and literature at Bennington College.
