  "description": "<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 NOW A NETFLIX FILM \u2022\u00a0A remarkable tale of the island of Guernsey during the German Occupation, and of a society as extraordinary as its name. \u201cTreat yourself to this book, please\u2014I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\u201d\u2014Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love \u201cI wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\u201d January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she\u2019s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb. . . . As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends\u2014and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u2014born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island\u2014boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society\u2019s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</p>\n\n<p>Praise for The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\u201cA jewel . . . Poignant and keenly observed, Guernsey is a small masterpiece about love, war, and the immeasurable sustenance to be found in good books and good friends.\u201d\u2014People \u201cA book-lover\u2019s delight, an implicit and sometimes explicit paean to all things literary.\u201d\u2014Chicago Sun-Times \u201cA sparkling epistolary novel radiating wit, lightly worn erudition and written with great assurance and aplomb.\u201d\u2014The Sunday Times (London) \u201cCooked perfectly \u00e0 point: subtle and elegant in flavour, yet emotionally satisfying to the finish.\u201d\u2014The Times (London)</p>"
