  "description": "<p>Set in Boston at the end of the First World War, The Given Day tells the story of two families - one white, one black Beat cop, Danny Coughlin, the son of one of the city s most powerful police captains, is on the hunt for hard-line radicals.</p>\n\n<p>Drawn into the political fray, he soon finds his loyalties compromised. Luther Laurence, on the run after a deadly confrontation with a crime boss, works for the Coughlin family, all the while desperately trying to find a way home to his pregnant wife. As Danny, Luther and those around them face increasingly turbulent times, they are forced to ride a rising storm of hardship and deprivation that will change their lives forever. Coursing through some of the pivotal events of the age, Dennis Lehane s masterly new novel explores the crippling violence and irrepressible exuberance of a country at war with, and in thrall of, itself.</p>"
