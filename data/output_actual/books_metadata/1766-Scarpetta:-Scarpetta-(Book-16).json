The handcuffed and chained patient, Oscar Bane, has specifically asked for her, and when she literally has her gloved hands on him, he begins to talk\u2014and the story he has to tell turns out to be one of the most bizarre she has ever heard.</p>\n\n<p>The injuries, he says, were sustained in the course of a murder . . . that he did not commit.

The one thing Scarpetta knows for certain is that a woman has been tortured and murdered\u2014and more violent deaths will follow. . . .</p>"
