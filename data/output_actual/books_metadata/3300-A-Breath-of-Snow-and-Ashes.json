  "description": "<div><p>Eagerly anticipated by her legions of fans, this sixth novel in Diana Gabaldon\u2019s bestselling Outlander saga is a masterpiece of historical fiction from one of the most popular authors of our time.<br></p><p>Since the initial publication of <strong>Outlander</strong> fifteen years ago, Diana Gabaldon\u2019s <em>New York Times</em> bestselling saga has won the hearts of readers the world over \u2014 and sold more than twelve million books. Now, <strong>A Breath of Snow and Ashes</strong> continues the extraordinary story of 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his 20th-century wife, Claire.<br></p><p>The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.<br></p><p>With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence \u2014 with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from <em>The Wilmington Gazette</em>, dated 1776, which reports Jamie\u2019s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.<br></p><p><em>From the Hardcover edition.</em></p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>After waiting nearly four years since <em>The Fiery Cross</em> (2001), readers will find every expectation fulfilled in the sixth book of the popular Outlander series. Gabaldon shines as she unfolds the continuing story of the Frasers, heartbreakingly heroic highlander Jamie and his time-traveling wife Clare. Set during the three years leading up to the American Revolution, this compulsively readable mix of authentically set historical fiction and completely satisfying romance maps both violent loss and strong family ties. On the eve of war much is changing on Fraser's Ridge and Jamie and Claire encounter much harm. This vivid and haunting novel, therefore, brings an aching sadness, but it is balanced with sheer joy, revelation, and solace. The large scope of the novel allows Gabaldon to do what she does best, paint in exquisite detail the lives of her characters. Gabaldon's ability to invoke the heroic and the harrowing writ large, while also creating moments where you dare not take a breath for fear of missing something tiny and fine, is her hallmark. For it is in describing the sound of rain on the roof, Jamie's injured hand, or the understanding between father and daughter that the world of the novel comes alive and offers readers an enthralling experience. <em>Neal Wyatt</em><br><em>Copyright \u00a9 American Library Association.
