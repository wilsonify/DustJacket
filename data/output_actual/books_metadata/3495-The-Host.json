  "description": "<p class=\"description\"><span id=\"freeText11661944860391497062\" style=\"\">Melanie Stryder refuses\n to fade away. Our world has been invaded by an unseen enemy. Humans \nbecome hosts for these invaders, their minds taken over while their \nbodies remain intact and continue their lives apparently unchanged. Most\n of humanity has succumbed.<br><br>When Melanie, one of the few \nremaining \"wild\" humans, is captured, she is certain it is her end. \nWanderer, the invading \"soul\" who has been given Melanie's body, was \nwarned about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming \nemotions, the glut of senses, the too-vivid memories. But there was one \ndifficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body \nrefusing to relinquish possession of her mind.<br><br>Wanderer probes \nMelanie's thoughts, hoping to discover the whereabouts of the remaining \nhuman resistance. Instead, Melanie fills Wanderer's mind with visions of\n the man Melanie loves - Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. \nUnable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer begins to \nyearn for a man she has been tasked with exposing. When outside forces \nmake Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off on a dangerous \nand uncertain search for the man they both love.</span></p>"
