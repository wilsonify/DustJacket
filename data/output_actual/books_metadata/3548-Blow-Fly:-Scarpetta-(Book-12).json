A woman is found dead in a seedy hotel, dressed to go out, keys in her hand. Her history of blackouts, and her violent outbursts while under their spell, offer more questions than clues about the cause of her death.\u00a0Then Scarpetta receives news that chills her to the core: Jean-Baptiste Chandonne\u2014the vicious and unrepentant Wolfman, who pursued her to her very doorstep\u2014has asked to see her. From his cell on death row, he demands an audience with the legendary Dr. Scarpetta.\u00a0With friends and family by her side, Scarpetta tries to guess what sort of endgame this madman has in mind and how, if at all, it\u2019s related to the Louisiana case. She begins to unravel a twisting, international conspiracy and then confronts the shock of her life: a blow that will force her to question the loyalty and trust of all she holds dear.</p>"
