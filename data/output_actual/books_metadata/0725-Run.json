  "description": "Tonight, they\u2019re reading the names of those to be killed on the Emergency Broadcast System. You\u2019re listening over the radio in your kitchen, and they\u2019ve just read yours. Your name is Jack. You have a wife, daughter, and a young son. People are coming to kill you and your family. You don\u2019t know why, but you don\u2019t have time to think about that any more. You only have time to run."
