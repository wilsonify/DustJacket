  "description": "<p>Today's rapidly changing marketplace can seem like a jungle for many professionals. Engineering &amp; Management Press offers the books needed to navigate through the wilderness of business techniques and acronyms. EMP's titles provide practical information and proven business methods for most corporate and industrial environments. Our titles cover crucial, timely topics of importance to businesses and managers today -- management, productivity improvement, quality, and related issues.</p>\n\n<p>Born through efforts to catch up with the auto industries of Western nations after World War II, the Toyota, or Just-In-Time (JIT), production system was established primarily to increase productivity and reduce costs. Today, JIT is the most efficient production system in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Since the first edition was published in 1983, the Toyota production system has continued to evolve. Toyota has integrated JIT with computer integrated manufacturing technology and a strategic information system, further adjusting their system so that it remains the most effective system in use today. The reasons for integrating technology are discussed, as well as the problems encountered and their solutions.</p>"
