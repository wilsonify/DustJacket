  "description": "<p>The third installment of Scott Westerfeld\u2019s New York Times bestselling and award-winning Uglies series\u2014a global phenomenon that started the dystopian trend.</p>\n\n<p>Tally thought they were a rumor, but now she\u2019s one of them. A Special. A super-amped fighting machine, engineered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid. But maybe being perfectly programmed with strength and focus isn\u2019t better than anything she\u2019s ever known. Tally still has memories of something else. Still, it\u2019s easy to tune that out\u2014until she\u2019s offered a chance to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke permanently. It all comes down to one last choice: listen to that tiny, faint heartbeat, or carry out the mission she\u2019s programmed to complete. Either way, Tally\u2019s world will never be the same.</p>"
