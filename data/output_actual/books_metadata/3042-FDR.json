  "description": "<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p><em>Starred Review.</em> Independent biographer Smith (1996's <em>John Marshall: Definer of a Nation </em>and 2001's <em>Grant</em>) crafts a magisterial biography of our most important modern president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Scores of books have been written about Roosevelt, exploring every nook and cranny of his experience, so Smith breaks no \"news\" and offers no previously undisclosed revelations concerning the man from Hyde Park. But the author's eloquent synthesis of FDR's complex and compelling life is remarkably executed and a joy to read. Drawing on the papers of the Franklin Roosevelt Presidential Library as well as Columbia University's oral history collection and other repositories, Smith minutely explores the arc of FDR's intertwined political and private lives. With regard to the political, the biographer seamlessly traces Roosevelt's evolution from gawky, aristocratic, political newcomer nibbling at the edges of the rough-and-tumble Dutchess County, N.Y., Democratic machine to the consummate though physically crippled political insider\u2014a man without pretensions who acquired and performed the jobs of New York governor and then United States president with shrewd, and always joyous, efficiency. As is appropriate, more than half of Smith's narrative deals with FDR as president: the four terms (from 1933 until his death in 1945) during which he waged war, in turn, on the Depression and the Axis powers. As for the private Roosevelt, Smith reveals him as a devoted son; an unhappy husband who eventually settled into an uneasy peace and working partnership with his wife and cousin Eleanor; an emotionally absent father; and a man who for years devotedly loved two women other than his wife\u2014Lucy Mercer Rutherford and Missy LeHand, the latter his secretary. This erudite but graceful volume illuminates FDR's life for scholars, history buffs and casual readers alike.

All rights reserved. </p><h3>From The New Yorker</h3><p>As Franklin Roosevelt approached the stage at the 1936 Democratic Convention, the steel braces on his useless legs and the support of his son\u2019s arm allowing him, in great pain, to simulate walking, he was jostled, and he crashed to the ground, scattering the pages of his speech. \"Clean me up,\" he said, \"and keep your feet off those damned sheets.\" Minutes later, utterly poised, he told an audience and a nation ravaged by the Depression that they had \"a rendezvous with destiny.\" Smith, in this remarkable, sympathetic biography, doesn\u2019t flinch at Roosevelt\u2019s mistakes; the sections on the court-packing scheme and the internment of Japanese-Americans are painful to read. Smith also does a fine job with a complex marriage, avoiding the F.D.R. biographer\u2019s trap of being either annoyed or enraptured by Eleanor. The Roosevelt who emerges here\u2014neither a stranger nor a painted icon\u2014is flawed and magnificent. <br />Copyright \u00a9 2007 <em>Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker</em></p>"
