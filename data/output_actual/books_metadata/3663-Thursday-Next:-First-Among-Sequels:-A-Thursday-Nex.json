  "description": "<div>\n<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022\u00a0In this \u201chilarious [and] invigorating romp for all lovers of literature\u201d (Associated Press), Thursday Next returns to rescue reading from certain destruction\u2014again\u2014the \u201cmind-blowing\u201d (The Seattle Times) fifth installment of the renowned Thursday Next series.\u00a0\u201c[With a] furiously agile imagination . . . Fforde has shaken up genres\u2014fantasy, comedy, crime, sci-fi, parody, literary criticism\u2014and come up with a superb mishmash.\u201d\u2014The Miami Herald\u00a0Fourteen years after she pegged out at the 1988 SuperHoop, Thursday Next is grappling with a host of problems in the Book World: a recalcitrant new apprentice, the death of Sherlock Holmes, and the inexplicable departure of comedy from the once-hilarious Thomas Hardy novels. The Council of Genres is trying to broker a peace deal between certain antagonistic genres: Racy Novel has been recklessly placed between Ecclesiastical and Feminist, and they are at each other\u2019s throats.\u00a0Meanwhile, back in Swindon, the government is reporting a dangerously high stupidity surplus, and Thursday\u2019s idle sixteen-year-old son would rather sleep all day than follow his destiny as a member of the ChronoGuard. Not only does she captain the ship Moral Dilemma to the very limits of acceptable narrative possibilities, but Thursday also finds she must face down her most vicious enemy yet: herself.\u00a0Don\u2019t miss any of Jasper Fforde\u2019s delightfully entertaining Thursday Next novels:THE EYRE AFFAIR \u2022\u00a0LOST IN A GOOD BOOK \u2022\u00a0THE WELL OF LOST PLOTS \u2022\u00a0SOMETHING ROTTEN \u2022\u00a0FIRST AMONG SEQUELS \u2022\u00a0ONE OF OUR THURSDAYS IS MISSING \u2022\u00a0THE WOMAN WHO DIED A LOT</p></div>"
