  "description": "<p>On the morning she will never forget, suburban teenager Cynthia Archer discovers her house is empty, with no sign of her parents or younger brother Todd. Her family has simply disappeared. Twenty-five years later, married with a daughter of her own, Cynthia fears that her new family will be taken from her just as her first one was. Then a letter arrives which makes no sense and yet chills Cynthia to the core.</p>"
