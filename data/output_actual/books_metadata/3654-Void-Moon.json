  "description": "SUMMARY: Void of Moon The Emotional Journey Through Marital Separation Void of Moon, The Emotional Journey Through Marital Separation is based on the author, Denise Falcone's, personal journey and the experiences of many women through this strange and unfamiliar time. Each chapter or stage in this process deals with a single emotion or an important effect that all women must work through before their journey is complete. The author's personal interpretations give voice to each emotion so women can listen and recognize the feeling as it resonates within them. Once a connection to a feeling is established, a woman is not as alone in this process as she thought she was. From there, she can accept her feeling, experience it, and hopefully move through it. We all have emotions and it is this focus on the emotions that gives this book a huge audience. Void of Moon helps to open the way for women who are separating from their spouses, emotionally and/or physically with encouragement, guidance, and company on their path, while leading them gently in the direction of greater sanity and peace."
