  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nThey love nothing better than sipping free-trade gourmet coffee, leafing through the Sunday *New York Times*, and listening to David Sedaris on NPR (ideally all at the same time). Apple products, indie music, food co-ops, and vintage T-shirts make them weak in the knees. They believe they\u2019re unique, yet somehow they\u2019re all exactly the same, talking about how they \u201cget\u201d Sarah Silverman\u2019s \u201csubversive\u201d comedy and Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cdroll\u201d films. They\u2019re also down with diversity and up on all the best microbrews, breakfast spots, foreign cinema, and authentic sushi. They\u2019re organic, ironic, and do not own TVs. You know who they are: They\u2019re white people. And they\u2019re here, and you\u2019re gonna have to deal.

It gently mocks the habits and pretensions of urbane, educated, left-leaning whites, skewering their passion for Barack Obama and public transportation (as long as it's not a bus), their idle threats to move to Canada, and joy in playing children's games as adults.
