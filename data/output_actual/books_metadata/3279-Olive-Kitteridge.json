  "description": "<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Starred Review. Thirteen linked tales from Strout (_Abide with Me_, etc.) present a heart-wrenching, penetrating portrait of ordinary coastal Mainers living lives of quiet grief intermingled with flashes of human connection. The opening Pharmacy focuses on terse, dry junior high-school teacher Olive Kitteridge and her gregarious pharmacist husband, Henry, both of whom have survived the loss of a psychologically damaged parent, and both of whom suffer painful attractions to co-workers. Their son, Christopher, takes center stage in A Little Burst, which describes his wedding in humorous, somewhat disturbing detail, and in Security, where Olive, in her 70s, visits Christopher and his family in New York. Strout's fiction showcases her ability to reveal through familiar details\u2014the mother-of-the-groom's wedding dress, a grandmother's disapproving observations of how her grandchildren are raised\u2014the seeds of tragedy. Themes of suicide, depression, bad communication, aging and love, run through these stories, none more vivid or touching than Incoming Tide, where Olive chats with former student Kevin Coulson as they watch waitress Patty Howe by the seashore, all three struggling with their own misgivings about life. Like this story, the collection is easy to read and impossible to forget. Its literary craft and emotional power will surprise readers unfamiliar with Strout. <em>(Apr.)</em> <br>Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Die alone,\u201d\u00a0says Olive Kitteridge, redoubtable seventh-grade math teacher in Crosby, Maine. Anyone who gets in Olive\u2019s way\u00a0had better watch out, for she crashes unapologetically through life like an emotional storm trooper. She\u00a0forces her husband, Henry, the town pharmacist, into tactical retreat; and she drives her beloved son,\u00a0Christopher, across the country and into therapy. But\u00a0appalling though\u00a0Olive can be, Strout\u00a0\u00a0manages to make her deeply human and even sympathetic, as are\u00a0all of the characters in this \u201cnovel in stories.\u201d Covering a period of 30-odd years, most of the stories\u00a0(several of which were previously published in the New Yorker and other magazines) feature Olive as\u00a0 their\u00a0focus, but in some she is\u00a0bit\u00a0player or\u00a0even a footnote while other characters\u00a0take center stage to sort through their own fears and insecurities. Though loneliness and loss haunt these pages,\u00a0Strout also supplies\u00a0gentle humor and\u00a0a nourishing dose of hope. People are sustained by the rhythms of ordinary life and the natural wonders\u00a0of coastal\u00a0Maine,\u00a0and even Olive is sometimes\u00a0caught off guard\u00a0by life\u2019s baffling beauty. Strout is also the author of the well-received Amy and Isabelle (1999) and Abide with Me (2006). --Mary Ellen Quinn </p></div>"
