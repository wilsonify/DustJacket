As families prepare to head back to the city \nand children say goodbye to summer, a stranger is found murdered in the \nvillage bistro and antiques store. Once again, Chief Inspector Gamache \nand his team are called in to strip back layers of lies, exposing both \ntreasures and rancid secrets buried in the wilderness. <br><br>No one \nadmits to knowing the murdered man, but as secrets are revealed, chaos \nbegins to close in on the beloved bistro owner, Olivier. How did he make\n such a spectacular success of his business? What past did he leave \nbehind and why has he buried himself in this tiny village? And why does \nevery lead in the investigation find its way back to him? <br><br>As Olivier grows more frantic, a trail of clues and treasures -  from first editions of <i>Charlotte's Web </i>and <i>Jane Eyre </i>to\n a spider web with the word 'WOE'  woven in it - lead the Chief \nInspector deep into the woods and across the continent in search of the \ntruth, and finally back to Three Pines as the little village braces for \nthe truth and the final, brutal telling.<br></div>"
