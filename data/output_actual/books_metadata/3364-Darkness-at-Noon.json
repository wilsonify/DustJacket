  "description": "<div><p><strong>Originally published in 1941, Arthur Koestler's modern masterpiece, <em>Darkness At Noon,</em> is a powerful and haunting portrait of a Communist revolutionary caught in the vicious fray of the Moscow show trials of the late 1930s.</strong></p><p>During Stalin's purges, Nicholas Rubashov, an aging revolutionary, is imprisoned and psychologically tortured by the party he has devoted his life to. Under mounting pressure to confess to crimes he did not commit, Rubashov relives a career that embodies the ironies and betrayals of a revolutionary dictatorship that believes it is an instrument of liberation. </p><p>A seminal work of twentieth-century literature, <em>Darkness At Noon</em> is a penetrating exploration of the moral danger inherent in a system that is willing to enforce its beliefs by any means necessary.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"One of the few books written in this epoch which will survive it.\"</p><p>-- <em>New Statesman</em> (UK)<br></p><p>\"It is the sort of novel that transcends ordinary limitations. Written with such dramatic power, with such warmth of feeling, and with such persuasive simplicity that it is as absorbing as melodrama.\"</p><p>-- <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><br></p><p>\"A rare and beautifully executed novel.\"</p><p>-- <em>New York Herald Tribune</em><br></p><p>\"A remarkable book. A grimly fascinating interpretation of the logic of the Russian revolution, indeed of all revolutionary dictatorships, and at the same time a tense and subtly intellectualized drama.\"</p><p>-- <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> (London) </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Born in Budapest in 1905, educated in Vienna, Arthur Koestler immersed himself in the major ideological and social conflicts of his time. A communist during the 1930s, and visitor for a time in the Soviet Union, he became disillusioned with the Party and left it in 1938.\u00a0 Later that year in Spain, he was captured by the Fascist forces under Franco, and sentenced to death. Released through the last-minute intervention of the British government, he went to France where, the following year, he again was arrested for his political views.\u00a0 Released in 1940, he went to England, where he made his home. His novels, reportage, autobiographical works, and political and cultural writings established him as an important\u00a0commentator on the dilemmas of the 20th century. He died in 1983. </p></div>"
