  "description": "<div><p>Diana Gabaldon\u2019s brilliant storytelling has captivated millions of readers in her bestselling and award-winning Outlander saga. Now, in <strong>An Echo in the Bone</strong>, the enormously anticipated seventh volume, Gabaldon continues the extraordinary story of the eighteenth-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his twentieth-century time-traveling wife, Claire Randall.<br></p><p>Jamie Fraser, former Jacobite and reluctant rebel, is already certain of three things about the American rebellion: The Americans will win, fighting on the side of victory is no guarantee of survival, and he\u2019d rather die than have to face his illegitimate son\u2013a young lieutenant in the British army\u2013across the barrel of a gun.<br></p><p>Claire Randall knows that the Americans will win, too, but not what the ultimate price may be. That price won\u2019t include Jamie\u2019s life or his happiness, though\u2013not if she has anything to say about it.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, in the relative safety of the twentieth century, Jamie and Claire\u2019s daughter, Brianna, and her husband, Roger MacKenzie, have resettled in a historic Scottish home where, across a chasm of two centuries, the unfolding drama of Brianna\u2019s parents\u2019 story comes to life through Claire\u2019s letters. The fragile pages reveal Claire\u2019s love for battle-scarred Jamie Fraser and their flight from North Carolina to the high seas, where they encounter privateers and ocean battles\u2013as Brianna and Roger search for clues not only to Claire\u2019s fate but to their own. Because the future of the MacKenzie family in the Highlands is mysteriously, irrevocably, and intimately entwined with life and death in war-torn colonial America.<br></p><p>With stunning cameos of historical characters from Benedict Arnold to Benjamin Franklin, An Echo in the Bone is a soaring masterpiece of imagination, insight, character, and adventure\u2013a novel that echoes in the mind long after the last page is turned.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>\u201cAll you\u2019ve come to expect from Gabaldon . . . adventure, history, romance, fantasy.\u201d<br>\u2014<em>The Arizona Republic<br></em><br></p><p><em>From the Trade Paperback edition.</em></p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Diana Gabaldon is the New York Times bestselling author of the wildly popular Outlander novels\u2013<strong>Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager, Drums of Autumn, The Fiery Cross</strong>, and <strong>A Breath of Snow and Ashes</strong> (for which she won a Quill Award and the Corine International Book Prize)\u2013and one work of nonfiction,<strong> The Outlandish Companion</strong>, as well as the bestselling series featuring Lord John Grey, a character she introduced in<strong> Voyager</strong>.
