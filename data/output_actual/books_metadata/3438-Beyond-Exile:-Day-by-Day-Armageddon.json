The man kept his resolution and brought to us the fall of humanity, *day by day*. We see the man transition from the life that you and I live to the prospect of fighting for his very survival against the overwhelming hordes of the dead. We see him bleed, we see him make mistakes, we witness him evolve. The highly anticipated sequel to the bestselling underground cult classic,\u00a0*Day by Day Armageddon*\u00a0begins where the first novel left off.**BEGIN INTERCEPT******Armies of undead have risen up across the U.S. and around the globe;there is no safe haven from the diseased corpses hungering for human flesh.
