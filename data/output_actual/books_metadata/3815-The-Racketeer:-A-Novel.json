Judge Raymond Fawcett has just become number five.  His body is found in his remote lakeside cabin. There is no sign of forced entry or struggle. Just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied. \u00a0 One man, a former attorney, knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and why. But that man, Malcolm Bannister, is currently residing in the Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland. Though serving time, Malcolm has an ace up his sleeve. He has information the FBI would love to know. Malcolm would love to tell them. But everything has a price\u2014and the man known as the Racketeer wasn\u2019t born yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t miss John Grisham\u2019s new book, THE EXCHANGE: AFTER THE FIRM!</p>"
