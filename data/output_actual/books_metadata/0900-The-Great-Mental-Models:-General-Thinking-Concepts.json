  "description": "<p>The old saying goes, ''To the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.'' But anyone who has done any kind of project knows a hammer often isn't enough. \nThe more tools you have at your disposal, the more likely you'll use the right tool for the job -- and get it done right. \nThe same is true when it comes to your thinking. The quality of your outcomes depends on the mental models in your head. And most people are going through life with little more than a hammer. \nUntil now. \n<em>The Great Mental Models: General Thinking Concepts</em> is the first book in The Great Mental Models series designed to upgrade your thinking with the best, most useful and powerful tools so you always have the right one on hand. \nThis volume details nine of the most versatile, all-purpose mental models you can use right away to improve your decision making, productivity, and how clearly you see the world. You will discover what forces govern the universe and how to focus your efforts so you can harness them to your advantage, rather than fight with them or worse yet-- ignore them. \nUpgrade your mental toolbox and get the first volume today.\n**</p>"
