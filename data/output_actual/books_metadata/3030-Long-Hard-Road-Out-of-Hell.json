  "description": "<div><p>The best-selling autobiography of America\u2019s most controversial celebrity icon, Marilyn Manson (with a bonus chapter not in the hardcover).</p><p>In his twenty-nine years, rock idol Manson has experienced more than most people have (or would want to) in a lifetime. Now, in his shocking and candid memoir, he takes readers from backstage to gaol cells, from recording studios to emergency rooms, from the pit of despair to the top of the charts, and recounts his metamorphosis from a frightened Christian schoolboy into the most feared and revered music superstar in the country. Illustrated with dozens of exclusive photographs and featuring a behind-the-scenes account of his headline-grabbing Dead to the World tour.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>One doesn't usually think of rock stars as insightful, but, against all odds, glam-trash superstar Marilyn Manson has written a book that is actually an intelligent look at growing up. This autobiographical bildungsroman brings out the creepiest aspects of childhood, conveying the terror and fascination that young Marilyn (then called Brian) felt when looking through his grandfather's pornography, getting his first French kiss, and being taunted by the girls he wanted to \"date.\" Manson has the benefit of having grown up as an outcast and loser and then having become a star without forgetting what he went through. This gives him an incredibly broad perspective, which he brings to bear on his ordinary life in order to convey the more potent and frightening moments that shaped him into the pale-skinned weirdo that the Christian Right loves to hate. Best of all, Manson is shockingly honest, and portrays himself as occasionally stupid, self-centered, over-sensitive, ignoble, and, mostly, highly fallible and human. It's a long way from the auto-hagiographies that other stars have written, and it's easily one of the best reads in celebrity bio. <em>--James DiGiovanna</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"By turns moving, funny, appalling, and disturbing...There has never been anything like it.\" -- <em>-- </em>Rolling Stone<em><br></em></p><p><em>\"Amusing...lots of sex, bondage, drugs, intrigue, and mental decay.\" -- <em>-- </em>Village Voice<em><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"By turns moving, funny, appalling, and disturbing...There has never been anything like it.\" -- <strong>Rolling Stone</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Clipped, colorful prose that fits the author's larger-than-life personality like a pair of rubber shorts.\" -- <strong>Paper</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Fascinating, sleazy account of his coming of age and ascent into damnation.\" -- <strong>Us</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"If the Marquis De Sade had a son in a hard-rock band who wrote a book, this would be the book.\" -- <strong>Christian Science Monitor</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Makes Madonna's infamous <em>Sex</em> seem downright wholesome by comparison.\" -- <strong>Elle</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Nothing short of captivating in all its intentional, over-the-top bad taste.\" -- <strong>Edge</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Repulsive...well-written and uncommonly addictive.\" -- <strong>Chicago Sun-Times</strong><br></em></em></p><p><em><em>\"Unimaginably perverse and demented.\" -- <strong>Newsweek</strong></em></em></p></div>"
