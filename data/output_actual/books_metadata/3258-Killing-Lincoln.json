  "description": "<h3>Review</h3><p>\"As a history major, I wish my required reading had been as well written as this truly vivid and emotionally engaging account of Lincoln's assassination. And as a former combat infantry officer, I found myself running for cover at the Civil War battle scenes. This is the story of an American tragedy that changed the course of history. If you think you know this story, you don't until you\u2019ve read <em>Killing Lincoln</em>. Add historian to Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s already impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\"\u2014Nelson DeMille, author of <em>The Lion </em>and<em> The Gold Coast</em></p><p>\"<em>Killing Lincoln</em> is a must read historical thriller. Bill O'Reilly recounts the dramatic events of the spring of 1865 with such exhilarating immediacy that you will feel like you are walking the streets of Washington, DC, on the night that John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln. This is a hugely entertaining, heart-stopping read.\"\u2014Vince Flynn, author of <em>American Assassin</em><em /></p><p>\"If Grisham wrote a novel about April 1865...it might well read like <em>Killing Lincoln</em>.\"\u2014Peter J. Boyer, <em>Newsweek</em></p><h3>Product Description</h3><p><strong>A riveting historical narrative of the heart-stopping events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the first work of history from mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly</strong></p><p>The anchor of <em>The O'Reilly Factor</em> recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history\u2014how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally comes to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased.</p><p>In the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth\u2014charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist\u2014murders Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensues and Booth immediately becomes the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unravels the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces track his accomplices. The thrilling chase ends in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions\u2014including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt. Featuring some of history's most remarkable figures, vivid detail, and page-turning action, <em>Killing Lincoln</em> is history that reads like a thriller. </p>"
