  "description": "SUMMARY:\nThinner, bigger, faster, stronger... which 150 pages will you read? Is it possible to: Reach your genetic potential in 6 months? Sleep 2 hours per day and perform better than on 8 hours? Lose more fat than a marathoner by bingeing?   Indeed, and much more. This is not just another diet and fitness book.  The 4-Hour Body is the result of an obsessive quest, spanning more than a decade, to hack the human body. It contains the collective wisdom of hundreds of elite athletes, dozens of MDs, and thousands of hours of jaw-dropping personal experimentation. From Olympic training centers to black-market laboratories, from Silicon Valley to South Africa, Tim Ferriss, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The 4-Hour Workweek, fixated on one life-changing question:   For all things physical, what are the tiniest changes that produce the biggest results?  Thousands of tests later, this book contains the answers for both men and women.  From the gym to the bedroom, it\u2019s all here, and it all works.

There are more than 50 topics covered, all with real-world experiments, many including more than 200 test subjects.  You don't need better genetics or more discipline. You need immediate results that compel you to continue.  That\u2019s exactly what The 4-Hour Body delivers.From the Hardcover edition."
