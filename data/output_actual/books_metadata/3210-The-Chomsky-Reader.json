  "description": "<div><h3>From Library Journal</h3><p>From the 1960s to the present, linguist Chomsky has been a prominent critic of American foreign policy, influential in radical and scholarly circles. This collection offers a broad sampling of Chomsky's best writing on the subject. The essays are typical Chomsky: long, analytical, probing, and controversial. Some have appeared in earlier collections; others are expanded transcripts of recent lectures. The most familiar are concerned with U.S. policy in Vietnam, Central America, and the Middle East. Editor Peck gives us an overview of Chomsky's writings in his useful introduction, though he tends to be extravagant in his praise. Even more useful is a long interview with Chomsky himself. Highly recommended for all academic libraries. Thomas A. Karel, Franklin &amp; Marshall Coll. Lib., Lancaster, Pa.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p><h3>Product Description</h3><p>The political and linguistic writings of America's leading dissident intellectual. He relates his political ideals to his theories about language. </p> </div>"
