  "description": "<div><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Diana Gabaldon mesmerized readers with her award-winning <strong>Outlander </strong>novels, four dazzling tales featuring eighteenth-century Scotsman James Fraser and his twentieth-century time-traveling wife, Claire Randall. Now, in this eagerly awaited fifth volume, Diana Gabaldon continues their extraordinary saga, a masterpiece of pure storytelling that is her most astonishing <strong>Outlander </strong>novel yet....<br></p><p>The year is 1771, and war is coming. Jamie Fraser\u2019s wife tells him so. Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful prophecy\u2014a time-traveler\u2019 s certain knowledge. Claire\u2019s unique view of the future has brought him both danger and deliverance in the past; her knowledge of the oncoming revolution is a flickering torch that may light his way through the perilous years ahead\u2014or ignite a conflagration that will leave their lives in ashes.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>The fiery cross, once used to summon Highland clans to war, now beckons readers to take up Diana Gabaldon's fifth installment in the Outlander series featuring the time-traveling Frasers. Historical fiction fans who have waited four long years since the publication of <em>Drums of Autumn</em> will thrill to Gabaldon's trademark detail and sensuality, both displayed liberally throughout the nearly 1,000 pages of <em>The Fiery Cross</em>. In this pre-Revolutionary War period, Claire Fraser and her husband, Jamie, have crossed oceans and centuries to build a life together in the bucolic beauty of North Carolina. But tensions both ancient and recent threaten not only Claire and James, but their daughter, Brianna, her new husband, Roger, and their infant son, Jemmy, as well as members of their clan. Gabaldon delivers on what she does best: poignant storylines, empathetic characters, meticulous detail, and searing passion. Savor every carefully chosen word, readers; it may be a long time until the next installment! <em>--Alison Trinkle</em></p><h3>From Library Journal</h3><p>Get ready for Gabaldon. Starting in July, the publisher will set the stage for her latest by actively promoting her backlist titles featuring 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser. In the new novel, Jamie learns from his 20th-century wife that the American Revolution is coming. <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p></div>"
