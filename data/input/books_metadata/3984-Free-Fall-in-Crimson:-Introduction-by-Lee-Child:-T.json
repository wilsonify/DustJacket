  "description": "<p>'MacDonald had a huge influence on me . . . Reacher is like a fully detached version of Travis McGee' LEE CHILD Travis McGee isn\u2019t your typical knight in shining armour. He only works when his cash runs out, and his rule is simple: He\u2019ll help you find whatever was taken from you, as long as he can keep half. Ellis Esterland was rich, mean, and slowly succumbing to cancer \u2013 until someone hastened the inevitable by beating him to death. His son wants Travis McGee to find out who killed his estranged father. The \u2018why\u2019 seems obvious: his hotly contested, multimillion-dollar estate.</p>\n\n<p>McGee\u2019s quest takes him from Hollywood to the Midwest, from prostitution rings to drug deals gone wrong. In the haze of violence surrounding him, McGee is in danger of losing himself. But one thing remains crystal clear: he is on the trail of a killer conjured from his worst nightmares.</p>\n\n<p>First published in 1981, Free Fall in Crimson features an introduction by Lee ChildJOHN D.
