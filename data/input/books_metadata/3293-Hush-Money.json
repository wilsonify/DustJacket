  "description": "<p>In the shadows of deceit and danger, Spencer and sidekick Hawk confront the undoings at a distinguished university.</p>\n\n<p>Spenser has his hands full when he takes on two cases at once. In the first, a high-minded university might be hiding a killer within a swamp of political correctness. And in the other, Spenser comes to the aid of a stalking victim, only to find himself the unwilling object of the woman's dangerous affection.</p>"
