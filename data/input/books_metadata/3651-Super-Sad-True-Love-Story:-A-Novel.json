  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nThe author of two critically acclaimed novels, **The Russian Debutante\u2019s Handbook** and **Absurdistan**, Gary Shteyngart has risen to the top of the fiction world. Now, in his hilarious and heartfelt new novel, he envisions a deliciously dark tale of America\u2019s dysfunctional coming years\u2014and the timeless and tender feelings that just might bring us back from the brink.In a very near future\u2014oh, let\u2019s say next Tuesday\u2014a functionally illiterate America is about to collapse. But don\u2019t that tell that to poor Lenny Abramov, the thirty-nine-year-old son of an angry Russian immigrant janitor, proud author of what may well be the world\u2019s last diary, and less-proud owner of a bald spot shaped like the great state of Ohio. Despite his job at an outfit called Post-Human Services, which attempts to provide immortality for its super-rich clientele, death is clearly stalking this cholesterol-rich morsel of a man. And why shouldn\u2019t it? Lenny\u2019s from a different century\u2014he totally loves books (or \u201cprinted, bound media artifacts,\u201d as they\u2019re now known), even though most of his peers find them smelly and annoying. But even more than books, Lenny loves Eunice Park, an impossibly cute and impossibly cruel twenty-four-year-old Korean American woman who just graduated from Elderbird College with a major in Images and a minor in Assertiveness.After meeting Lenny on an extended Roman holiday, blistering Eunice puts that Assertiveness minor to work, teaching our \u201cancient dork\u201d effective new ways to brush his teeth and making him buy a cottony nonflammable wardrobe. But America proves less flame-resistant than Lenny\u2019s new threads. The country is crushed by a credit crisis, riots break out in New York\u2019s Central Park, the city\u2019s streets are lined with National Guard tanks on every corner, the dollar is so over, and our patient Chinese creditors may just be ready to foreclose on the whole mess. Undeterred, Lenny vows to love both Eunice and his homeland. He\u2019s going to convince his fickle new love that in a time without standards or stability, in a world where single people can determine a dating prospect\u2019s \u201chotness\u201d and \u201csustainability\u201d with the click of a button, in a society where the privileged may live forever but the unfortunate will die all too soon, there is still value in being a real human being.Wildly funny, rich, and humane, **Super Sad True Love Story** is a knockout novel by a young master, a book in which falling in love just may redeem a planet falling apart."
