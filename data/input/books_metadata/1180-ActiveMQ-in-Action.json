  "description": "<p>Applications in enterprises need to communicate, most commonly done by messaging. Apache ActiveMQ is an open-source implementation of the Java Message Service (JMS), which provides messaging in Java applications.</p>\n\n<p>ActiveMQ in Action is a thorough, practical guide to implementing message-oriented systems using ActiveMQ and Java. Co-authored by one of the leading ActiveMQ developers, Bruce Snyder, the book starts with the anatomy of a core Java message, then moves quickly through fundamentals including data persistence, authentication and authorization. Later chapters cover advanced features such as configuration and performance tuning, illustrating each concept with a running real-world stock portfolio application.</p>\n\n<p>Readers will learn to integrate ActiveMQ with Apache Geronimo and JBoss, and tie into both Java and non-Java technologies including AJAX, .NET, C++, Ruby, and the Spring framework. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.</p>"
