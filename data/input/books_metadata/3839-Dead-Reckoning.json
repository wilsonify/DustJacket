  "description": "<div><p class=\"description\">SUMMARY:<br>The brand-new True Blood novel, starring the irrepressible Sookie Stackhouse. How can you resist? With her knack for being in trouble's way, Sookie witnesses the firebombing of Merlotte's, the bar where she works. Since Sam Merlotte is now known to be two-natured, suspicion falls immediately on the anti-shifters in the area. But Sookie suspects otherwise and she and Sam work together to uncover the culprit - and the twisted motive for the attack. But her attention is divided. Though she can't 'read' vampires, Sookie knows her lover Eric Northman and his 'child' Pam well - and she realises that they are plotting to kill the vampire who is now their master. Gradually, she is drawn into the plot - which is much more complicated than she knows. Caught up in the politics of the vampire world, Sookie will learn that she is as much of a pawn as any ordinary human - and that there is a new Queen on the board.</p> <h3>Product Description</h3><p><strong>New in the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Sookie Stackhouse series-the basis for HBO(r)'s <em>True Blood</em>!</strong> </p><p>With her knack for being in trouble's way, Sookie witnesses the firebombing of Merlotte's, the bar where she works.
