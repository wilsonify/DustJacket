  "description": "<div><p>Saul Bellow evokes all the rich colors and exotic customs of a highly imaginary Africa in this acclaimed comic novel about a middle-aged American millionaire who, seeking a new, more rewarding life, descends upon an African tribe. Henderson\u2019s awesome feats of strength and his unbridled passion for life win him the admiration of the tribe\u2014but it is his gift for making rain that turns him from mere hero into messiah. A hilarious, often ribald story, <em>Henderson the Rain King</em> is also a profound look at the forces that drive a man through life.</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Bellow's classic novel of a dissatisfied American millionaire finding himself in Africa has been newly recorded in time for the novel's 50th anniversary. Joe Barrett reads the seriocomic tale of Eugene Henderson, who flees workaday American anomie for the freeing chaos of Africa. Barrett's voice is pleasingly gravelly, rimed with experience and rising to a growling screech at particularly heated moments. Every audio recording should be so lucky as to work with Bellow's prose, but this version, directed by Keith Reynolds, is more than adequate. Barrett is to be commended for sounding like a man of Bellow's era, not his own; one can almost picture Bellow's voice emitting a similar blend of assurance and self-conscious anxiety. <em>A Viking hardcover.
