  "description": "<div><p>R is a young man with an existential crisis--he is a zombie. He shuffles through an America destroyed by war, social collapse, and the mindless hunger of his undead comrades, but he craves something more than blood and brains. He can speak just a few grunted syllables, but his inner life is deep, full of wonder and longing. He has no memories, noidentity, and no pulse, but he has dreams.</p><p>After experiencing a teenage boy's memories while consuming his brain, R makes an unexpected choice that begins a tense, awkward, and stragely sweet relationship with the victim's human girlfriend. Julie is a blast of color in the otherwise dreary and gray landscape that surrounds R. His decision to protect her will transform not only R, but his fellow Dead, and perhaps their whole lifeless world. </p><p>Scary, funny, and surprisingly poignant, Warm Bodies is about being alive, being dead, and the blurry line in between.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>\u201cElegantly written, touching, and fun.\u201d (Audrey Niffenegger, #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Time Traveler's Wife</em> )<br></p><p>\u201cDark and funny.\u201d (<strong>Wired</strong> )<br></p><p>\u201c<em>Warm Bodies</em> is a terrific zombook.
