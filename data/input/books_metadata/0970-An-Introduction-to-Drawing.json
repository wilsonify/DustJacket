  "description": "<p>Mark-making is a basic human instinct, and it's something that we take to with joyous unselfconsciousness long before we reach school and formal learning. As we grow older, however, we become more conscious of what we can't do and the whole business of art can begin to seem beyond our reach.<br>In <i>An Introduction to Drawing</i>, artist and teacher Robin Hazlewood restores that lost confidence by his belief that most of us can draw as long as we learn to see objects as they are in reality. As adults, when we look at a subject we invest it with everything our experience tells us about it and attempt to convey that in our drawing - and that is where we encounter unnecessary complications and find ourselves with an unsatisfactory result.<br>This book discusses basic techniques and gives exercises to provide you with plenty of practice in coordinating hand and eye. Most importantly, it helps you to find a new way of looking and to develop a fresh vision of the world around you.</p>"
