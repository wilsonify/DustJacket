  "description": "<p>'MacDonald had a huge influence on me . . . Reacher is like a fully detached version of Travis McGee' LEE CHILD Travis McGee isn\u2019t your typical knight in shining armour. He only works when his cash runs out, and his rule is simple: He\u2019ll help you find whatever was taken from you, as long as he can keep half. The funny thing about favours: sometimes they come back to haunt you. And Travis McGee owes a friend a big one. Little surprise that he finds himself on a trip to Hawaii to help out his friend\u2019s daughter, who is convinced her husband is trying to kill her. But Travis can\u2019t find a single thing wrong and puts her paranoia down to simple anxiety. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s back home that he realises he may have overlooked a clue or two. And that she might be in very real danger . . .First published in 1973, The Turquoise Lament features an introduction by Lee ChildJOHN D.
