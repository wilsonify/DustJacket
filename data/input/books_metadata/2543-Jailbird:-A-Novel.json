  "description": "<p><strong>\u201c[Kurt Vonnegut] has never been more satirically on-target. . . . Nothing is spared.\u201d\u2014</strong> People *  </p>\n<p>Jailbird* takes us into a fractured and comic, pure Vonnegut world of high crimes and misdemeanors in government\u2014and in the heart. This wry tale follows bumbling bureaucrat Walter F. Starbuck from Harvard to the Nixon White House to the penitentiary as Watergate\u2019s least known co-conspirator. But the humor turns dark when Vonnegut shines his spotlight on the cold hearts and calculated greed of the mighty, giving a razor-sharp edge to an unforgettable portrait of power and politics in our times.  </p>\n<p><strong>Praise for</strong> Jailbird  </p>\n<p>\u201c[Vonnegut] is our strongest writer . . . the most stubbornly imaginative.\u201d <strong>\u2014John Irving</strong>  </p>\n<p>\u201cA gem . . . a mature, imaginative novel\u2014possibly the best he has written . . . <em>Jailbird</em> is a guided tour de force of America.
