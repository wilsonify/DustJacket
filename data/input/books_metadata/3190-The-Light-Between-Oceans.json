When a baby washes up in a rowboat, he and his young wife Isabel decide to raise the child as their own. The baby seems like a gift from God, and the couple\u2019s reasoning for keeping her seduces the reader into entering the waters of treacherous morality even as Tom--whose moral code withstood the horrors of World War I--begins to waver. M. L. Stedman\u2019s vivid characters and gorgeous descriptions of the solitude of Janus Rock and of the unpredictable Australian frontier create a perfect backdrop for the tale of longing, loss, and the overwhelming love for a child that is <em>The Light Between Oceans</em>. --<em>Malissa Kent</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p>\u201cAn extraordinary and heart-rending book about good people, tragic decisions and the beauty found in each of them.\u201d<strong>\u2014Markus Zusak, author of *The Book Thief</strong>*<br></p><p>\u201cM.L. Stedman\u2019s <em>The Light Between Oceans </em>is a beautiful novel about isolation and courage in the face of enormous loss. It gets into your heart stealthily, until you stop hoping the characters will make different choices and find you can only watch, transfixed, as every conceivable choice becomes an impossible one. I couldn\u2019t look away from the page and then I couldn\u2019t see it, through tears. It\u2019s a stunning debut.\u201d<strong>\u2014Maile Meloy, author of *Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It</strong><em>*<br></em></p><p><em>\u201cM.L. Stedman, a spectacularly sure storyteller, swept me to a remote island nearly a century ago, where a lighthouse keeper and his wife make a choice that shatters many lives, including their own. This is a novel in which justice for one character means another\u2019s tragic loss, and we care desperately for both. Reading <em>The Light Between Oceans</em> is a total-immersion experience, extraordinarily moving.\u201d<strong>\u2014Monica Ali, author of <em>Brick Lane </em>and* Untold Story</strong>*<br></em></p><p><em>\"Irresistible...seductive...a high concept plot that keeps you riveted from the first page.\"<strong>\u2014Sara Nelson, <em>O</em>, the Oprah magazine</strong><br></em></p><p><em>\u201cHaunting...Stedman draws the reader into her emotionally complex story right from the beginning, with lush descriptions of this savage<strong> </strong>and beautiful landscape, and vivid characters with whom we can readily empathize.
