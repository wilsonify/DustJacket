  "description": "<div>\n<p>Instant #1 New York Times bestseller! \u2022 #1 Washington Post bestseller! \u2022 #1 Indie Bestseller! \u2022 USA Today Bestseller!John Green, award-winning author and passionate advocate for global healthcare reform, tells a deeply human story illuminating the fight against the world\u2019s deadliest infectious disease. \u201cThe real magic of Green\u2019s writing is the deeply considerate, human touch that goes into every word.\u201d \u2013The Associated Press\u201cThis highly readable call to action could not be more timely.\u201d \u2013Kirkus, starred review\u201cEarnest and empathetic.\u201d \u2013The New York TimesTuberculosis has been entwined with hu\u00admanity for millennia. Once romanticized as a malady of poets, today tuberculosis is seen as a disease of poverty that walks the trails of injustice and inequity we blazed for it. </p>\n<p>In 2019, author John Green met Henry Reider, a young tuberculosis patient at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. John be\u00adcame fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile. In the years since that first visit to Lakka, Green has become a vocal advocate for increased access to treatment and wider awareness of the healthcare inequi\u00adties that allow this curable, preventable infec\u00adtious disease to also be the deadliest, killing over a million people every year. </p>\n<p>In Everything Is Tuberculosis, John tells Henry\u2019s story, woven through with the scientific and social histories of how tuberculosis has shaped our world\u2014and how our choices will shape the future of tuberculosis.</p></div>"
