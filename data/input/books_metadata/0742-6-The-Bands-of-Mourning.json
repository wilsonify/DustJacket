  "description": "<div><p><strong>The #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author returns to the world of <em>Mistborn </em>with the follow-up to <strong><em>*</em>Shadows of Self</strong>*<br>\n</strong></p>\n<p>With <em>The Alloy of Law </em>and <em>Shadows of Self</em>, Brandon Sanderson surprised readers with a <em>New York Times </em>bestselling spinoff of his Mistborn books, set after the action of the trilogy, in a period corresponding to late 19th-century America.</p>\n<p>Now, with <em>The Bands of Mourning</em>, Sanderson continues the story. The Bands of Mourning are the mythical metalminds owned by the Lord Ruler, said to grant anyone who wears them the powers that the Lord Ruler had at his command. Hardly anyone thinks they really exist. A kandra researcher has returned to Elendel with images that seem to depict the Bands, as well as writings in a language that no one can read. Waxillium Ladrian is recruited to travel south to the city of New Seran to investigate. Along the way he discovers hints that point to the true goals of his uncle Edwarn and the shadowy organization known as The Set.</p>\n<p>**</p><h3>Review</h3>\n<p>\u201cSanderson is an evil genius. There is simply no other way to describe what he's managed to pull off in this transcendent final volume of his Mistborn trilogy.\u201d \u2015<em>RT Book Reviews (Gold Medal, Top Pick!) on The Hero of Ages</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt's rare for a fiction writer to have much understanding of how leadership works and how love really takes root in the human heart. Sanderson is astonishingly wise.\u201d \u2015<em>Orson Scott Card</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSanderson is crafting an extremely well-thought out saga with Mistborn, one that looks to stand above the pack of his literary peers. The magic system is perfectly detailed, the world, though not completely revealed, has a great sense of natural logic to it, and the characters are a reflection of both.\u201d \u2015<em>SFFWorld</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIntrigue, politics, and conspiracies mesh complexly in a world Sanderson realizes in satisfying depth and peoples with impressive characters.\u201d \u2015<em>Booklist on Mistborn</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHighly recommended to anyone hungry for a good read.\u201d \u2015<em>Robin Hobb on Mistborn</em></p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoyable, adventurous read.\u201d \u2015<em>Locus on Mistborn</em></p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p><strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong> is the bestselling author of books including <em>Warbreaker</em>, <em>Elantris</em>, The Stormlight Archive series, starting with <em>The Way of Kings</em>, and The Mistborn series-<em>Mistborn</em>, <em>The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages </em>and <em>The Alloy of Law</em>.
