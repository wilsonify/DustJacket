Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.\u00a0As an adolescent America searched for its unique identity among the nations of the world, a number of thinkers and writers emerged eager to share their vision of what the American character could be. Among their leaders was Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose essays, lectures, and poems defined the American transcendentalist movement, though he himself disliked the term. Emerson advocates a rejection of fear-driven conformity, a total independence of thought and spirit, and a life lived in harmony with nature. He believes that Truth lies within each individual, for each is part of a greater whole, a universal \u201cover-soul\u201d through which we transcend the merely mortal. Emerson was extremely prolific throughout his life; his collected writings fill forty volumes. This edition contains his major works, including Nature, the essays \u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d \u201cThe American Scholar,\u201d \u201cThe Over-Soul,\u201d \u201cCircles,\u201d \u201cThe Poet,\u201d and \u201cExperience,\u201d, and such important poems as \u201cThe Rhodora,\u201d \u201cUriel,\u201d \u201cThe Humble-Bee,\u201d \u201cEarth-Song,\u201d \u201cGive All to Love,\u201d and the well-loved \u201cConcord Hymn.\u201d Includes a comprehensive glossary of names. Peter Norberg has been Assistant Professor of English at Saint Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia since 1997. A specialist in New England transcendentalism and the history of the antebellum period, he also has published on Herman Melville\u2019s poetry. He currently is writing a history of Emerson\u2019s career as a public lecturer."
