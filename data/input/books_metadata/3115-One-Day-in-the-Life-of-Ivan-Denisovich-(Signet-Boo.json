  "description": "<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Solzhenitsyn's first book, this economical, relentless novel is one of the most forceful artistic indictments of political oppression in the Stalin-era Soviet Union. The simply told story of a typical, grueling day of the titular character's life in a labor camp in Siberia, is a modern classic of Russian literature and quickly cemented Solzhenitsyn's international reputation upon publication in 1962. It is painfully apparent that Solzhenitsyn himself spent time in the gulags--he was imprisoned for nearly a decade as punishment for making derogatory statements about Stalin in a letter to a friend. </p><h3>Review</h3><p>Short novel by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, published in Russian in 1962 as Odin den Ivana Denisovicha in the Soviet literary magazine Novy Mir, and published in book form the following year. Solzhenitsyn's first literary work--a treatment of his experiences in the Stalinist labor camps--established his reputation and foreshadowed his masterpiece, The Gulag Archipelago (1973-75). Set in the forced-labor camp in which the author was interned from 1950 to 1953, Ivan Denisovich describes a typical day in the life of an inmate. Published during Nikita Khrushchev's de-Stalinization program, the work was released without interference from Soviet government censors and Solzhenitsyn became an instant celebrity. -- __</p>\n\n\n<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Solzhenitsyn's first book, this economical, relentless novel is one of the most forceful artistic indictments of political oppression in the Stalin-era Soviet Union.
