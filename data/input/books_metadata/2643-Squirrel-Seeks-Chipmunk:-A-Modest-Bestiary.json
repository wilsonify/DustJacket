  "description": "SUMMARY: Featuring David Sedaris's unique blend of hilarity and heart, this new collection of keen-eyed animal-themed tales is an utter delight. Though the characters may not be human, the situations in these stories bear an uncanny resemblance to the insanity of everyday life. In \"The Toad, the Turtle, and the Duck,\" three strangers commiserate about animal bureaucracy while waiting in a complaint line. In \"Hello Kitty,\" a cynical feline struggles to sit through his prison-mandated AA meetings. In \"The Squirrel and the Chipmunk,\" a pair of star-crossed lovers is separated by prejudiced family members.Once again David Sedaris shows us the most outrageous, tender, absurd sides of ourselves in his \"profoundly funny, well-crafted stories that somehow, magically, bring home a major point about fidelity or guilt or love\" (Christian Science Monitor)."
