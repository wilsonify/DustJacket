Take it!\"\u00a0\u00a0-- <em>Playboy</em> -- <em>Review</em></p><h3>Product Description</h3><p><em>Jailbird</em> takes us into a fractured and comic, pure Vonnegut world of high crimes and misdemeanors in government. . .and in the heart. This wry tale follows bumbling bureaucrat Walter F. Starbuck from Harvard to the Nixon White House to the penitentiary as Watergate's least known co-conspirator. But the humor turns dark when Vonnegut shines his spotlight on the cold hearts and calculated greed of the mighty, giving a razor-sharp edge to an unforgettable portait of power and politics in our times. </p>\n\n</div>"
