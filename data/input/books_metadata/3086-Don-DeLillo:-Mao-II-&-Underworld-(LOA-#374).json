  "description": "<p>The definitive edition of a modern master continues with 2 mid-career masterpieces, published here with new prefaces from the authorThis second volume in the Library of America DeLillo edition collects two extraordinary novels he published in the 1990s, the peak of his career.</p>\n\n<p>In the PEN/Faulkner Award\u2013winning Mao II (1991), the celebrated novelist Bill Gray has withdrawn into seclusion, his everyday affairs managed by a pair of assistants. And yet within the protective solitude he has built for himself he still finds himself struggling\u2014with pills and with a novel he can\u2019t manage to complete. A visit from a Swedish photographer who specializes in author portraits spurs him to shake off his world-weariness, and soon the reclusive writer is embarked on an unlikely journey to help broker the release of a poet held hostage by terrorists in Beirut. Mao II, writes the critic Sven Birkerts, is \u201cDeLillo\u2019s strongest statement yet about the crisis of crises. Namely, that we are living in the last violet twilight of the individual, and that \u2018the future belongs to crowds.\u2019\u201dUnderworld (1997), DeLillo\u2019s magnum opus and a book that ranks among the greatest of twentieth-century novels, is a sprawling, ambitious, and moving panorama of the postwar American experience. It begins with a tour de force re-imagination of one of the great moments in sports: the decisive pennant game between the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Polo Grounds in 1951, culminating in the now legendary \u201cshot heard \u2019round the world\u201d home run by Bobby Thomson. In DeLillo\u2019s hands the excitement of the game is juxtaposed with something far more momentous, the announcement of the Soviets\u2019 first atomic test\u2014a coincidence that initiates a kaleidoscopic saga that is woven across more than four decades, shuttling back and forth through time and mixing fictional characters with historical figures such as Lenny Bruce and J. Edgar Hoover. The novel is at once a profound meditation on our contemporary condition and a deeply personal book for its author, drawing poignantly on his memories of growing up in the Bronx. \u201cAll of DeLillo is in Underworld,\u201d writes Harold Bloom. \u201cDeLillo\u2019s sense of America, in the second half of the twentieth century, is achieved perfectly.\u201dHere is the ultimate gift for DeLillo fans and perfect introduction for readers interested in discovering or rediscovering a great American writer.</p>"
