    "\u201cI quite like Probability and Statistics for Data Science: Math + R + Data. I believe that the book describes itself quite well when it says: Mathematically correct yet highly intuitive...This book would be great for a class that one takes before one takes my statistical learning class. I often run into beginning graduate Data Science students whose background is not math (e.g.",
    "CS or Business) and they are not ready...The book fills an important niche in that it provides a self-contained introduction to material that is useful for a higher-level statistical learning course...It compares well with competing books",
