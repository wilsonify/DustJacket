  "description": "<p>Now with over 10 million copies sold, The Mistborn Series has the thrills of a heist story, the twistiness of political intrigue, and the epic scale of a landmark fantasy saga.</p>\n\n<p>They did the impossible, ending the thousand-year reign of the godlike Lord Ruler. Now Vin, the former street urchin turned powerful Mistborn, and Elend Venture, the idealistic young nobleman who loves her, must build a healthy new society in the ashes of an empire.</p>\n\n<p>As tensions grow in the wake of the uprising, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.</p>\n\n<p>It may just be that killing the Lord Ruler was the easy part. Surviving the aftermath of his fall is going to be the real challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight Archive\u25cf The Way of Kings\u25cf Words of Radiance\u25cf Edgedancer (novella)\u25cf Oathbringer\u25cf Dawnshard (novella)\u25cf Rhythm of War\u25cf Wind and TruthThe Mistborn SagaThe Original Trilogy\u25cf Mistborn\u25cf The Well of Ascension\u25cf The Hero of AgesWax &amp; Wayne\u25cf The Alloy of Law\u25cf Shadows of Self\u25cf The Bands of Mourning\u25cf The Lost MetalOther Cosmere novels\u25cf Elantris\u25cf Warbreaker\u25cf Tress of the Emerald Sea\u25cf Yumi and the Nightmare Painter\u25cf The Sunlit ManCollection\u25cf Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere CollectionAlcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians\u25cf Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians\u25cf The Scrivener's Bones\u25cf The Knights of Crystallia\u25cf The Shattered Lens\u25cf The Dark Talent\u25cf Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians (with Janci Patterson)Other novels\u25cf The Rithmatist\u25cf Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds\u25cf The Frugal Wizard\u2019s Handbook for Surviving Medieval EnglandOther books by Brandon SandersonThe Reckoners\u25cf Steelheart\u25cf Firefight\u25cf Calamity\u25cf Lux (with Steven Michael Bohls)Skyward\u25cf Skyward\u25cf Starsight\u25cf Cytonic\u25cf Skyward Flight (with Janci Patterson)\u25cf DefiantAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>"
