How much do parents really want to know about their kids?  </p>\n<h1>1 bestselling author Harlan Coben asks that provocative and terrifying question with his fifteenth thriller.**</h1>\n<h1>1 bestselling author Harlan Coben has become an unstoppable force in suspense fiction. His most recent novel, <em>The Woods</em> , spent more time on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list than his previous books and sales reached his highest levels to date. His latest page-turner, which is about just how far parents will go to protect their kids, is destined for the top of every bestseller list.</h1>\n<p>Tia and Mike Baye never imagined they'd become the type of overprotective parents who spy on their kids. But their sixteen-year-old son Adam has been unusually distant lately, and after the suicide of his classmate Spencer Hill'the latest in a string of issues at school'they can't help but worry. They install a sophisticated spy program on Adam's computer, and within days are jolted by a message from an unknown correspondent addressed to their son: 'Just stay quiet and all safe.'  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, browsing through an online memorial for Spencer put together by his classmates, Betsy Hill is struck by a photo that appears to have been taken on the night of her son's death . . . and he wasn't alone. She thinks it is Adam Baye standing just outside the camera's range; but when Adam goes missing, it soon becomes clear that something deep and sinister has infected their community. For Tia and Mike Baye, the question they must answer is this: When it comes to your kids, is it possible to know too much?</p>"
