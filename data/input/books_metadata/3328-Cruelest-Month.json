The book's title is a metaphor not only for the month of April but also for Gamache's personal and professional challenges---making this the series standout so far.\u201d\u00a0<br>--Sarah Weinman<br><br>Welcome to Three Pines, where the cruelest month is about to deliver on its threat.<br>It's spring in the tiny, forgotten village; buds are on the trees and the first flowers are struggling through the newly thawed earth. But not everything is meant to return to life. . .<br>When some villagers decide to celebrate Easter with a s\u00e9ance at the Old Hadley House, they are hoping to rid the town of its evil---until one of their party dies of fright. Was this a natural death, or was the victim somehow helped along?<br>Brilliant, compassionate Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec is called to investigate, in a case that will force him to face his own ghosts as well as those of a seemingly idyllic town where relationships are far more dangerous than they seem.</div></div></div></div>"
