Settling herself in the shadow of Slains Castle, she creates a heroine named for one of her own ancestors and starts to write.</p><p>But when she discovers her novel is more fact than fiction, Carrie wonders if she might be dealing with ancestral memory, making her the only living person who knows the truth\u2014the ultimate betrayal\u2014that happened all those years ago, and that knowledge comes very close to destroying her...</p><p><b>What readers say:</b></p><p><i>\"Kearsley weaves an airtight spell that alternates and mingles the past with the present... Kudos go to her ending that, believe it or not, had this jaded reader blinking back both tears and smiles of surprise and approval. Well...</i></p></div>"
