  "description": "<p>'MacDonald had a huge influence on me . . . Reacher is like a fully detached version of Travis McGee' LEE CHILD Travis McGee isn\u2019t your typical knight in shining armour. He only works when his cash runs out, and his rule is simple: He\u2019ll help you find whatever was taken from you, as long as he can keep half. As a boat captain, Van Harder\u2019s reputation is his most valuable possession. But his wealthy employer has gone missing, presumed dead, and people are pointing the finger. They say he was drunk at the helm when his employer went overboard. But Harder insists he doesn\u2019t drink . . . at least, not any more. And he wants his reputation back. But who would believe him? To help him, Travis McGee must do the impossible: prove that a dead man is actually alive . . .First published in 1978, The Empty Copper Sea features an introduction by Lee ChildJOHN D.
