  "description": "\"Sure there are no more beautiful thing to see in a house, a building, a mansion, a castle or a sports field that green and pure grass without weeds, and where we can see it from our children playing seniors enjoying a beautiful day or athletes trying to show their qualities and skills\"\n\nWith this simple but true phrase, Francisco the author of this manual defines which is one of the objectives of his work: Cooperate with homeowners and landscapers to improve our environment and make each day more habitable our planet.\n\nAlso the author Francisco  wants to do this objective easier than it frequently is , that is transmitted to all who purchase the Manual: \"my best grass\", the assurance that from now on will be much simpler to have a beautiful grass\n\nFrancisco   transmits all their knowledge, their studies, his investigations, their experience in working in companies # 1 in the retail industry for many years to all those who think like him: \n \n\n\"Caring for our grass, we will have a better environment. This is our power\"\n \n\nIf we had to summarize in two concepts this work would say: \"Simplicity\" and \"ready to use\".\n\nBesides this project does not end with this manual of Francisco, the author promises that will continue to transmit experiences through Internet which guarantees to keep in touch\n\nEnjoy it"
