  "description": "<p>When a recent skeleton among ancient bones raises questions\u2014and danger\u2014forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan is the only one who can solve the case in this \u201ctriumphant second appearance\u201d (Publishers Weekly) from #1 New York Times bestselling author Kathy Reichs.</p>\n\n<p>Tempe Brennan is stuck teaching an archaeology field school for students at UNCC in Charleston, South Carolina. When she stumbles upon a recent skeleton among the ancient bones, she starts asking questions. She\u2019s the expert they might have called in, but lucky for the police she\u2019s already there. The skeleton leads her to a free street clinic where patients have begun to go missing, and some have wound up dead. What is going on and who is to blame? The charismatic televangelist who oversees the clinic? The shady doctor who practices there? Or is it the clinic staff? Ryan is in Montreal, though he may come down for a visit. If he does, Tempe will have to juggle him and Detective Galiano, an old flame, who is in town investigating the disappearance of a wealthy young woman. This is a phenomenally high stakes business where one dead body can save a couple of lives, maybe more. Along with the corpses, Tempe investigates the sick moral logic of the mastermind behind the operation. Kathy Reichs has returned Tempe to America and put her in the middle of a sinister trafficking ring that\u2019s local and global. The suspense is intense, and the world is riveting. Kathy Reichs\u2019s books are expert and smart with a taut energy, and this is her best plot and writing yet.</p>"
