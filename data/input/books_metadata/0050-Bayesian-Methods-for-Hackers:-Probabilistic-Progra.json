  "description": "<p>Master Bayesian Inference through Practical Examples and Computation\u2013Without Advanced Mathematical Analysis   Bayesian methods of inference are deeply natural and extremely powerful. However, most discussions of Bayesian inference rely on intensely complex mathematical analyses and artificial examples, making it inaccessible to anyone without a strong mathematical background. Now, though, Cameron Davidson-Pilon introduces Bayesian inference from a computational perspective, bridging theory to practice\u2013freeing you to get results using computing power.   Bayesian Methods for Hackers illuminates Bayesian inference through probabilistic programming with the powerful PyMC language and the closely related Python tools NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Using this approach, you can reach effective solutions in small increments, without extensive mathematical intervention.   Davidson-Pilon begins by introducing the concepts underlying Bayesian inference, comparing it with other techniques and guiding you through building and training your first Bayesian model. Next, he introduces PyMC through a series of detailed examples and intuitive explanations that have been refined after extensive user feedback. You\u2019ll learn how to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, choose appropriate sample sizes and priors, work with loss functions, and apply Bayesian inference in domains ranging from finance to marketing. Once you\u2019ve mastered these techniques, you\u2019ll constantly turn to this guide for the working PyMC code you need to jumpstart future projects.   Coverage includes   \u2022 Learning the Bayesian \u201cstate of mind\u201d and its practical implications \u2022 Understanding how computers perform Bayesian inference \u2022 Using the PyMC Python library to program Bayesian analyses \u2022 Building and debugging models with PyMC \u2022 Testing your model\u2019s \u201cgoodness of fit\u201d \u2022 Opening the \u201cblack box\u201d of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to see how and why it works \u2022 Leveraging the power of the \u201cLaw of Large Numbers\u201d \u2022 Mastering key concepts, such as clustering, convergence, autocorrelation, and thinning \u2022 Using loss functions to measure an estimate\u2019s weaknesses based on your goals and desired outcomes \u2022 Selecting appropriate priors and understanding how their influence changes with dataset size \u2022 Overcoming the \u201cexploration versus exploitation\u201d dilemma: deciding when \u201cpretty good\u201d is good enough \u2022 Using Bayesian inference to improve A/B testing \u2022 Solving data science problems when only small amounts of data are available   Cameron Davidson-Pilon has worked in many areas of applied mathematics, from the evolutionary dynamics of genes and diseases to stochastic modeling of financial prices. His contributions to the open source community include lifelines, an implementation of survival analysis in Python. Educated at the University of Waterloo and at the Independent University of Moscow, he currently works with the online commerce leader Shopify.</p>"
