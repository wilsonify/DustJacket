  "description": "SUMMARY: In the summer of 1953, two eleven-year-old boys\u2014best friends\u2014are playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire. One of the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy\u2019s mother. The boy who hits the ball doesn\u2019t believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God\u2019s instrument. What happens to Owen, after that 1953 foul ball, is extraordinary and terrifying. A Prayer for Owen Meany was first published in 1989. This Modern Library edition includes a new Introduction by the author."
