  "description": "SUMMARY: The Belgariad Book #3 Ce'Nedra, Imperial Princess of Tolnedra, was confused. Everyone knows the tales of the Orb protecting the West from the evil God Torak are just silly legends. But here she is, forced to join a dangerous quest to recover that stolen Orb. No one believes in sorcery, but Garion's aunt and grandfather seem to be the fabled sorcerers Polgara and Belgarath. Even young Garion is learning to do socerey. Garion, a farm boy is totally unsuitable for an Imperial Princess. Yet, for some reason she has the urge to brush back his hair, and comfort him. Now he is going to a strange evil tower to face some horrible, powerful magician, and she cannot be there to watch over him. He might be killed, and she may never see him again."
