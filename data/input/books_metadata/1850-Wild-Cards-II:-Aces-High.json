  "description": "<p>After the alien virus struck humanity in the wake of World War II, a handful of the survivors found they possessed superhuman powers. The Wild Cards shared-world volumes tell their story.  Here in book two, Wild Cards II: Aces High, we trace these heroes and villains through the tumultuous 1980s, both like and unlike our own. Now, after centuries of travel through space, an extraterrestrial being called the Swarm is headed for Earth. Meanwhile, some of the aces given superpowers by the virus are hatching conspiracies to control the human world. These factions are about to collide...and the fallout could be catastrophic.  Featuring stories from SF and fantasy giants such as George R. R. Martin, Roger Zelazny, Pat Cadigan, Lewis Shiner, Walter Jon Williams, and others.</p>\n\n<p>The Wild Cards UniverseThe Original Triad#1 Wild Cards#2 Aces High#3 Jokers WildThe Puppetman Quartet#4: Aces Abroad#5: Down and Dirty#6: Ace in the Hole#7: Dead Man\u2019s HandThe Rox Triad#8: One-Eyed Jacks#9: Jokertown Shuffle#10: Dealer\u2019s Choice#11: Double Solitaire#12: Turn of the CardsThe Card Sharks Triad#13: Card Sharks#14: Marked Cards#15: Black Trump#16: Deuces Down#17: Death Draws FiveThe Committee Triad#18: Inside Straight#19: Busted Flush#20: Suicide KingsThe Fort Freak Triad#21: Fort Freak#22: Lowball#23: High StakesThe American Triad#24: Mississippi Roll#25: Low Chicago#26: Texas Hold 'EmAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.</p>"
