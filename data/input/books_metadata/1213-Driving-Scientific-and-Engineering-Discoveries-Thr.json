  "description": "<div>\n<p>This book constitutes the revised selected papers of the 17th Smoky Mountains Computational Sciences and Engineering Conference, SMC 2020, held in Oak Ridge, TN, USA*, in August 2020.The 36 full papers and 1 short paper presented were carefully reviewed and selected from a total of 94 submissions. The papers are organized in topical sections of computational applications: converged HPC and artificial intelligence; system software: data infrastructure and life cycle; experimental/observational applications: use cases that drive requirements for AI and HPC convergence; deploying computation: on the road to a converged ecosystem; scientific data challenges.*The conference was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></div>"
