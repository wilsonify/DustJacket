  "description": "<div><h3>From Library Journal</h3><p>In a startling departure from her previous novels ( Lady Oracle , Surfacing ), respected Canadian poet and novelist Atwood presents here a fable of the near future. In the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, far-right Schlafly/Falwell-type ideals have been carried to extremes in the monotheocratic government. The resulting society is a feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the \"morally fit\" Wives. The tale is told by Offred (read: \"of Fred\"), a Handmaid who recalls the past and tells how the chilling society came to be. This powerful, memorable novel is highly recommended for most libraries. BOMC featured alternate. Ann H. Fisher, Radford P.L., Va.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"The most poetically satisfying and intense of all Atwood's novels.\"-_Maclean's_  </p><p>\"The Handmaid's Tale is in the honorable tradition of <em>Brave New World</em> and other warnings of dystopia. It's imaginative even audacious, and conveys a chilling sense of fear and menace.\"-_The Globe and Mail_  </p><p>\"_The Handmaid's Tale_ brings out the very best in Atwood--moral vision, biting humor, and a poet's imagination.\"-_Chatelaine_  </p><p><em>From the Paperback edition.</em></p>\n\n</div>"
