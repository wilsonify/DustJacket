Kennedy, and the follow-up to \nmega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly's <i>Killing Lincoln</i>.</p> <p>More than a million readers have thrilled to Bill O'Reilly's <i>Killing Lincoln</i>,\n the page-turning work of nonfiction about the shocking assassination \nthat changed the course of American history. Now the anchor of <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>;\n recounts in gripping detail the brutal murder of John Fitzgerald \nKennedy--and how a sequence of gunshots on a Dallas afternoon not only \nkilled a beloved president but also sent the nation into the cataclysmic\n division of the Vietnam War and its culture-changing aftermath.</p> <p>In\n January 1961, as the Cold War escalates, John F. Kennedy struggles to \ncontain the growth of Communism while he learns the hardships, solitude,\n and temptations of what it means to be president of the United States. \nAlong the way he acquires a number of formidable enemies, among them \nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and Alan \nDulles, director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, \npowerful elements of organized crime have begun to talk about targeting \nthe president and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.</p> <p>In\n the midst of a 1963 campaign trip to Texas, Kennedy is gunned down by \nan erratic young drifter named Lee Harvey Oswald. The former Marine \nCorps sharpshooter escapes the scene, only to be caught and shot dead \nwhile in police custody.</p> <p>The events leading up to the most notorious crime of the twentieth century are almost as shocking as the assassination itself. <i>Killing Kennedy</i>\n chronicles both the heroism and deceit of Camelot, bringing history to \nlife in ways that will profoundly move the reader. This may well be the \nmost talked about book of the year.</p></div>\n         \n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"psGradient\" class=\"psGradient\" style=\"display: block;\"></div></div></div>"
