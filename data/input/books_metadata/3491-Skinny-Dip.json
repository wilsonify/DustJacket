  "description": "<p>A New York Times BestsellerChaz Perrone might be the only marine scientist in the world who doesn't know which way the Gulf Stream runs. He might also be the only one who went into biology just to make a killing, and now he's found a way - doctoring water samples so that a ruthless agribusiness tycoon can continue illegally dumping fertilizer into the endangered Everglades. When Chaz suspects that his wife, Joey, has figured out the scam, he pushes her overboard from a cruise liner int the night-dark Atlantic. Unfortunately for Chaz, his wife doesn't die in the fall. Plucked from the ocean by former cop and current loner Mick Stranahan, Joey decides to stay dead and (with Mick's help) screw with Chaz until he screws himself.</p>\n\n<p>About the author: Carl Hiaasen is the author of ten previous novels, including Sick Puppy, Lucky You, Stormy Weather, Basket Case, and, for young readers, Hoot. He also writes a regular column for the Miami Herald.&amp; His fifth novel, Strip Tease, was made into a movie starring Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds. Carl Hiaasen currently resides in the Florida Keys.</p>"
