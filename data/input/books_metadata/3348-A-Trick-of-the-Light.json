  "description": "<div><h3><font class=\"Apple-style-span\" size=\"3\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;\">Hearts are broken,' Lillian Dyson carefully underlined in a book. 'Sweet relationships are dead.'\u00a0<br>But now Lillian herself is dead. Found among the bleeding hearts and lilacs of Clara Morrow's garden in Three Pines, shattering the celebrations of Clara's solo show at the famed Mus\u00e9e in Montreal. Chief Inspector Gamache, the head of homicide at the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, is called to the tiny Quebec village and there he finds the art world gathered, and with it a world of shading and nuance, a world of shadow and light. Where nothing is as it seems. Behind every smile there lurks a sneer. Inside every sweet relationship there hides a broken heart. And even when facts are slowly exposed, it is no longer clear to Gamache and his team if what they've found is the truth, or simply a trick of the light.\u00a0</span></font></h3></div>"
