  "description": "<div>\n<p>One of the most popular interior design trends, minimalism highlights the essence of a room, stressing clean lines, clutter-free spaces, and a limited color palette. </p>\n<p>In 150 Best Minimalist House Ideas, photographs and floor plans of minimalist homes around the world are featured. The images are of stunning bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms; and insightful text complements them to reveal the methods used to make the minimalist rooms so eye-catching and desirable. The text includes a wealth of both big-picture and more focused ideas. It covers subjects such as walls (if and when to use them), doors, and partitions; flooring, lighting, furniture, and staircases; and explores color, patterns, materials, and texture. </p>\n<p>The houses featured in this extraordinary volume were developed by distinguished international designers at\u00a0the forefront of the minimalist movement. The result is a guide that offers both inspiration and practical, easy-to follow advice for creating maximum beauty using minimal elements.</p></div>"
