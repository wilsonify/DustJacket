  "description": "<div>\n<p>Named one of the \"100 Best Books of the Decade\" by The Times of London \"Oh my human brothers, let me tell you how it happened. </p>\n<p>\" A former Nazi officer, Dr. Maximilien Aue has reinvented himself, many years after the war, as a middle-class family man and factory owner in France. An intellectual steeped in philosophy, literature, and classical music, he is also a cold-blooded assassin and the consummate bureaucrat. Through the eyes of this cultivated yet monstrous man we experience in disturbingly precise detail the horrors of the Second World War and the Nazi genocide of the Jews. Eichmann, Himmler, G\u00d6ring, Speer, Heydrich, H\u00d6ss\u2014even Hitler himself\u2014play a role in Max's story. An intense and hallucinatory historical epic, The Kindly Ones is also a morally challenging read. It holds a mirror up to humanity\u2014and the reader cannot look away.</p></div>"
