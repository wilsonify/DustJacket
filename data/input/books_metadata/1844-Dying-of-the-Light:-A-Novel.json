  "description": "<p>In this unforgettable space opera, #1 New York Times bestselling author George R. R. Martin presents a chilling vision of eternal night\u2014a volatile world where cultures clash, codes of honor do not exist, and the hunter and the hunted are often interchangeable. \u00a0 A whisperjewel has summoned Dirk t\u2019Larien to Worlorn, and a love he thinks he lost. But Worlorn isn\u2019t the world Dirk imagined, and Gwen Delvano is no longer the woman he once knew. She is bound to another man, and to a dying planet that is trapped in twilight. Gwen needs Dirk\u2019s protection, and he will do anything to keep her safe, even if it means challenging the barbaric man who has claimed her. But an impenetrable veil of secrecy surrounds them all, and it\u2019s becoming impossible for Dirk to distinguish between his allies and his enemies. In this dangerous triangle, one is hurtling toward escape, another toward revenge, and the last toward a brutal, untimely demise. \u00a0Praise for Dying of the Light \u201cDying of the Light\u00a0blew the doors off of my idea of what fiction could be and could do, what a work of unbridled imagination could make a reader feel and believe.\u201d\u2014Michael Chabon\u201cSlick science fiction . . . the Wild West in outer space.\u201d\u2014Los Angeles Times \u00a0 \u201cSomething special which will keep Worlorn and its people in the reader\u2019s mind long after the final page is read.\u201d\u2014Galileo magazine \u00a0 \u201cThe galactic background is excellent. . . .
