  "description": "<div>It is Winter Carnival in Quebec City, bitterly cold and surpassingly \nbeautiful. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache has come not to celebrate but \nto recover from an investigation gone hauntingly wrong. But violent \ndeath is inescapable, even in the seemingly peaceful Literary and \nHistorical Society--where an obsessive historian's search for the \nmissing remains of the founder of Quebec ends bizarrely in murder. \nInjured himself and in need of rest, Gamache cannot walk away from a \ncrime that threatens to ignite long-smoldering tensions between the \nEnglish and the French.<br><br>Meanwhile, he receives letter after \nletter from the village of Three Pines, where beloved Bistro owner \nOlivier was recently convicted of murder. \"<i>It doesn't make sense,\" </i>Olivier's partner writes every day<i>. \"He didn't do it, you know.</i>\"\n Despite the overwhelming case against Olivier, Gamache sends his deputy\n back to Three Pines to make sure that nothing was overlooked.<br><br>Through\n it all, in his painstaking quest for justice, Gamache must relive the \nterrible events that killed one of his men before he can begin to bury \nhis dead.<br></div>"
