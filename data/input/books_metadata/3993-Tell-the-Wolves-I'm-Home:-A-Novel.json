There\u2019s only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that\u2019s her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn\u2019s company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June\u2019s world is turned upside down. But Finn\u2019s death brings a surprise acquaintance into June\u2019s life\u2014someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart.<br><br>At Finn\u2019s funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn\u2019s apartment, and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June realizes she\u2019s not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she needs the most.<br><br>An emotionally charged coming-of-age novel, <em>Tell the Wolves I\u2019m Home</em> is a tender story of love lost and found, an unforgettable portrait of the way compassion can make us whole again.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012</strong>: In <em>Tell the Wolves I\u2019m Home</em>, Carol Rifka Brunt has made a singular portrait of the late-\u201880s AIDS epidemic\u2019s transformation of a girl and her family. But beyond that, she tells a universal story of how love chooses us, and how flashes of our beloved live through us even after they\u2019re gone. Before her Uncle Finn died of an illness people don\u2019t want to talk about, 14-year-old June Elbus thought she was the center of his world. A famous and reclusive painter, Finn made her feel uniquely understood, privy to secret knowledge like how to really hear Mozart\u2019s <em>Requiem</em> or see the shape of negative space. When he\u2019s gone, she discovers he had a bigger secret: his longtime partner Toby, the only other person who misses him as much as she does. Her clandestine friendship with Toby\u2014who her parents blame for Finn\u2019s illness\u2014sharpens tensions with her sister, Greta, until their bond seems to exist only in the portrait Finn painted of them. With wry compassion, Brunt portrays the bitter lengths to which we will go to hide our soft underbellies, and how summoning the courage to be vulnerable is the only way to see through to each other\u2019s hungry, golden souls. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p><strong>Advance praise for *Tell the Wolves I\u2019m Home</strong><em><br><strong> </strong><br>\u201cIn this lovely debut novel set in the 1980s, Carol Rifka Brunt takes us under the skin and inside the tumultuous heart of June Elbus...Distracted parents, tussling adolescents, the awful ghost-world of the AIDS-afflicted before AZT\u2014all of it springs to life in Brunt\u2019s touching and ultimately hopeful book.\u201d--</em>People*<br></p><p>\u201c[A] transcendent debut...
