  "description": "<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Gretchen Lowell strikes again\u2014or does she?\u2014in bestseller Cain's grisly third thriller to feature the female serial killer who takes sadistic pleasure in taunting Portland, Ore., detective Archie Sheridan (after <em>Sweetheart</em> and <em>Heartsick</em>). A violent attack that leaves body parts in a rest stop bathroom, along with Lowell's signature heart design, persuades Sheridan, a recovering Vicodin addict, to leave rehab and rejoin the hunt for Lowell. As he and newspaper reporter Susan Ward dig deeper, they discover that while the corpses cropping up around town are reminiscent of Lowell's nasty handiwork, they might also point to one of the myriad fan clubs dedicated to the killer, who has become a media sensation since she escaped from prison in <em>Heartsick</em>. Even though readers may wonder how much longer this extended game can play out, Cain delivers her usual blend of organ-ripping, blood-soaked gore and compelling flawed heroes\u2014and antiheroes. <em>(Sept.)</em> <br>Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
