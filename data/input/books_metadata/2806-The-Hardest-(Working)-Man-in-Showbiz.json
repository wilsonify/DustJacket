  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\nHe's the porn world's Everyman. Blessed with an enormous \"talent\" yet average looks, he's starred in more than 1,700 adult films, directed 250 of them, and over the last twenty years has become porn's biggest ambassador to the mainstream. He's appeared in 60 regular films, 14 music videos, and VH1's *Surreal Life*, starred in the critically acclaimed *Porn star* (a movie about his life), and in *Being Ron Jeremy* (a take off on *Being John Malkovich*), co-starring Andy Dick. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. . . .  \n\n Ron Jeremy is a born storyteller (funny, considering he doesn't do a lot of talking in his films). He knows where all the bodies are buried, and in this outrageous autobiography he not only shows you the grave but also gives you the back story on the tombstone. Get ready for *Ron Jeremy*\u2014a scandalously entertaining deep insider's view of the porn industry and its emergence into popular culture, and a delectable self-portrait of the amazingly endowed Everyman every man wanted to be."
