  "description": "<p>In this mesmerizing thriller by Linwood Barclay, a man\u2019s life unravels around him when the unthinkable strikes.\u00a0A warm summer Saturday. An amusement park. David Harwood is glad to be spending some quality time with his wife, Jan, and their four-year-old son. But what begins as a pleasant family outing turns into a nightmare after an inexplicable disappearance. A frantic search only leads to an even more shocking and harrowing turn of events.\u00a0\u00a0Until this terrifying moment, David Harwood is just a small-town reporter in need of a break. His paper, the Promise Falls Standard, is struggling to survive. Then he gets a lead that just might be the answer to his prayers: a potential scandal involving a controversial development project for the outskirts of this picturesque upstate New York town. It\u2019s a hot-button issue that will surely sell papers and help reverse the Standard\u2019s fortunes, but strangely, David\u2019s editors keep shooting it down.\u00a0Why?\u00a0That\u2019s a question no longer at the top of David\u2019s list. Now the only thing he cares about is restoring his family. Desperate for any clue, David dives into his own investigation\u2014and into a web of lies and deceit. For with every new piece of evidence he uncovers, David finds more questions\u2014and moves ever closer to a shattering truth.</p>"
