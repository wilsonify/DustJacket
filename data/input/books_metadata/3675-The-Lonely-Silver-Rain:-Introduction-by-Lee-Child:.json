  "description": "<p>'MacDonald had a huge influence on me . . . Reacher is like a fully detached version of Travis McGee' LEE CHILD Travis McGee isn\u2019t your typical knight in shining armour. He only works when his cash runs out, and his rule is simple: He\u2019ll help you find whatever was taken from you, as long as he can keep half. McGee knows the dangerous link between Florida boatjackings and the drug trade, and he\u2019s vowed never to swim with the sharks. But when Billy Ingraham, a self-made tycoon, bets that McGee can locate his $700,000 custom cruiser, he decides to jump straight in.</p>\n\n<p>After a friend leads him to the stolen vessel, McGee immediately regrets not going with his gut. The yacht is no longer an ordinary boat. It\u2019s a slaughterhouse. Shortly followed by the return of a ghost from his past, Travis realises that this case may be his last . . .
