  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: Something is amiss at Unseen Unversity, Ankh-Morpork's most prestigious (i.e., only) institution of higher learning. **A professor is missing--but a search party is on the way!** A bevy of senior wizards will follow the trail wherever it leads--even to the other side of Discworld, where the Last Continent, Fourecks, is under construction. **Imagine a magical land** where rain is but a myth and the ordinary is strange and the past and present run side by side. **experience the terror** as you encounter a Mad Dwarf, the Peach Butt, and the dreaded Meat Pie Floater. **Feel the passion** as the denizens of the Last Continent learn what happens when rain falls and the rivers fill with water (it spoils regattas, for one thing). **Thrill to the promise* of next year's regatta, in remote, rustic Didjabringabeeralong. It'll be asolutely gujeroo (no worries)."
