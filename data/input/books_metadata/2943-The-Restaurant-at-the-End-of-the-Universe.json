  "description": "<p>Now celebrating the 42nd anniversary of\u00a0The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy,\u00a0soon to be a Hulu original series! \u201cDouglas Adams is a terrific satirist.\u201d\u2014The Washington Post Book WorldFacing annihilation at the hands of the warlike Vogons? Time for a cup of tea! Join the cosmically displaced Arthur Dent and his uncommon comrades in arms in their desperate search for a place to eat, as they hurtle across space powered by pure improbability.</p>\n\n<p>Among Arthur\u2019s motley shipmates are Ford Prefect, a longtime friend and expert contributor to The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed ex-president of the galaxy; Tricia McMillan, a fellow Earth refugee who\u2019s gone native (her name is Trillian now); and Marvin, the moody android. Their destination? The ultimate hot spot for an evening of apocalyptic entertainment and fine dining, where the food speaks for itself (literally).</p>\n\n<p>Will they make it? The answer: hard to say. But bear in mind that The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide deleted the term \u201cFuture Perfect\u201d from its pages, since it was discovered not to be!\u201cWhat\u2019s such fun is how amusing the galaxy looks through Adams\u2019s sardonically silly eyes.\u201d\u2014Detroit Free Press</p>"
