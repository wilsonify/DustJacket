  "description": "<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Book Description: </strong>In <em>Elizabeth Street</em>, Laurie Fabiano tells a remarkable, and previously unheard, story of the Italian immigrant experience at the start of the twentieth century. Culled from her own family history, Fabiano paints an entrancing portrait of Giovanna Costa, who, reeling from personal tragedies, tries to make a new life in a new world. Shot through with the smells and sights of Scilla, Italy, and New York\u2019s burgeoning Little Italy, this intoxicating story follows Giovanna as she finds companionship, celebrates the birth of a baby girl, takes pride in a growing business, and feels a sense of belonging on a family outing to Coney Island. </p><p>However, these modest successes are rewarded with the attention of the notorious Black Hand, a gang of brutal extortionists led by Lupo the Wolf. As the stakes grow higher and higher, readers share with Giovanna her desperate struggle to remain outside the fray, and then to fight for\u2014and finally to save\u2014that which is important above all other: family. </p><hr /><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Maria Laurino Reviews <em>Elizabeth Street</em></strong> </p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em> and <em>The Nation</em>, and her essays have been widely anthologized. Read her exclusive guest review of <em>Elizabeth Street</em>:</strong> </p><p>When readers first meet Giovanna Costa, the protagonist of <em>Elizabeth Street</em>, she is a young woman about to get married in the small Italian fishing village of Scilla, situated between the Calabrian coast and Sicily\u2019s Aeolian Islands. The town is home to the ancient story of Scylla, the once beautiful nymph turned mythical monster that devoured sailors trying to navigate the Straits of Messina. Midway through </p><p>Supporting herself in New York first as a midwife, Giovanna teams up with a woman doctor from northern Italy. The two become close friends and the doctor shares medical knowledge that Giovanna will combine with her holistic midwifery skills. But Giovanna\u2019s fate changes after deciding to open a small fruit and vegetable market with her new husband. The store is an easy source of potential revenue for criminals offering \"protection services,\" and soon Giovanna\u2019s family becomes their prey. With the same mix of disciplined study and the pinch of southern Italian mysticism that she applied to midwifery, Giovanna will take on the ruthless organized crime syndicate that has kidnapped her daughter and murdered the police lieutenant assigned to protect the neighborhood.</p><p>Mario Puzo once claimed, years after writing <em>Elizabeth Street</em> a southern Italian heroine fighting those criminal forces that have long victimized poor and vulnerable immigrants. In this multigenerational, well-researched tale, the reader also learns interesting details of the common struggles facing southern Europeans coming to America--how, for instance, Ellis Island inspectors were instructed to mark northern and southern Italians as two separate races; and how the wages for common laborers in parts of the country were divided into three categories, the highest salary paid to \"whites,\" the middle scale for \"coloreds,\" and the lowest amount to \"Italians.\"</p><p><em>Elizabeth Street</em> is both a fascinating immigrant story and an intimate portrait of how a first-generation American--and the author\u2019s own great-grandmother--outwits one of the most brutal crime organizations of the early 20th century. <em>--Maria Laurino</em></p><hr /><h3>From</h3><p>First novelist Fabiano is dead-on in her portrait of the Italian-American immigrant experience. This engrossing cross-generational saga centers on the experiences of Giovanna Costa, from the small Italian fishing village where she is born to the bustling streets of New York's Lower East Side where she struggles to raise her family and make a living as a midwife after the death of her first husband. In America, the resourceful Giovanna and her second husband eventually open a fruit and vegetable stand, attracting the unwanted attentions of the notorious \u201cBlack Hand\u201d crime organization. When Giovanni refuses to meet their demands, her daughter is kidnapped and held for ransom. Basing this story\u2014including the kidnapping\u2014on her own family's immigrant experiences, Fabiano provides a wealth of period detail, infusing the compulsively readable narrative with an authentic sense of time, place, and community. --Margaret Flanagan </p>"
