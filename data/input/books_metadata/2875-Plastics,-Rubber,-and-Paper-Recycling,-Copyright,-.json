    "THE ACS SYMPOSIUM SERIES was first published in 1974 to provide a mechanism for publishing symposia quickly in book form. The purpose of this series is to publish comprehensive books developed from symposia",
    "which are usually \"snapshots in time\" of the current research being done on a topic",
    "plus some review material on the topic. For this reason",
    "it is necessary that the papers be published as quickly as possible."
