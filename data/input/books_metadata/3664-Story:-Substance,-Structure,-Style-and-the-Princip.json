  "description": "<div><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Writing for the screen is quirky business. A writer must labor meticulously over his or her prose, yet very little of that prose is ever heard by filmgoers. The few words that do reach the audience, in the form of the characters' dialogue, are, according to Robert McKee, best left to last in the writing process. (\"As Alfred Hitchcock once remarked, 'When the screenplay has been written and the dialogue has been added, we're ready to shoot.' \") In <em>Story</em>, McKee puts into book form what he has been teaching screenwriters for years in his seminar on story structure, which is considered by many to be a prerequisite to the film biz. (The long list of film and television projects that McKee's students have written, directed, or produced includes <em>Air Force One</em>, <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, <em>E.R.</em>, <em>A Fish Called Wanda</em>, <em>Forrest Gump</em>, <em>NYPD Blue</em>, and <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>.) Legions of writers flock to Hollywood in search of easy money, calculating the best way to get rich quick. This book is not for them. McKee is passionate about the art of screenwriting. \"No one needs yet another recipe book on how to reheat Hollywood leftovers,\" he writes. \"We need a rediscovery of the underlying tenets of our art, the guiding principles that liberate talent.\" <em>Story</em> is a true path to just such a rediscovery. In it, McKee offers so much sound advice, drawing from sources as wide ranging as Aristotle and <em>Casablanca</em>, Stanislavski and <em>Chinatown</em>, that it is impossible not to come away feeling immeasurably better equipped to write a screenplay and infinitely more inspired to write a brilliant one.<em>--Jane Steinberg</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"... stimulating, innovative, refreshingly practical.\" -- <em>-- Lawrence Kasdan, Director</em><br></p><p>\"...the best guide on writing you can find.\" -- <em>Laurence Chollet, </em><em>The Record, Northern New Jersey</em><br></p><p>\"In difficult periods of writing, I often turn to Robert McKee's wonderful book for guidance\" -- <em>-- Dominick Dunne, Novelist</em><br></p><p>\"McKee is the Stanislavski of writing.\" -- <em>-- Dennis Dugan, Writer, NYPD Blue</em><br></p><p>\"[Story is]an excellent instruction manual on the craft of storytelling.\" -- <em><em>Austin American-Statesman</em><br></em></p><em><p>\"to the people who write, direct and produce for Hollywood - or desperately wish they did - Bob McKee is a cross between E.
