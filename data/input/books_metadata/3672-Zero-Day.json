  "description": "<p class=\"description\">SUMMARY:<br>An insidious cyber-terrorist attack threatens to destroy the Western World in this debut by a leading expert on cybersecurity Over the Atlantic, an airliner\u2019s controls suddenly stop reacting. In Japan, an oil tanker runs aground when its navigational system fails. And in the Midwest, a nuclear power plant nearly becomes the next Chernobyl. At first, these computer failures seem unrelated. But Jeff Aiken, a former government analyst who saw the mistakes made before 9/11, fears that there may be a more serious attack coming. And he soon realizes that there isn\u2019t much time if he hopes to stop an international disaster. Zero Day presents a chilling \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario written in the vein of Richard A. Clarke and Daniel Suarez.</p>"
