  "description": "<p>For a man of war, peacetime is the ultimate challenge. Leaving behind them a Europe still taking stock after the definitive battle of Waterloo, Jack Aubrey and his friend Stephen Maturin set sail for Chile. But even with the newly minted peace, life at sea remains beset with danger and imminent disaster, and the political turmoil of the South American continent is equal to any threat they have yet faced.  Out of loss \u2013 of purpose, of love \u2013 can the two friends rescue what they most desire?  \u2018Beyond his superbly elegant writing, wit and originality, [O\u2019Brian] showed an understanding of the nature of a floating world at the mercy of the wind and sea which has never been surpassed.\u2019MAX HASTINGS, Evening Standard \u2018From the opening page I was addicted to what I judge to be one of the greatest cycles of storytelling in the English language.\u2019WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, Daily Telegraph</p>"
