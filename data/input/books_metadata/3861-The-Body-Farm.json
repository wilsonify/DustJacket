She left a North Carolina church meeting late one October afternoon and strolled along a lakeside path toward her house two miles away. Who met her on the path? Who followed her home, kidnapped her from her bedroom, and left her body by the lake days later? It\u2019s a puzzling and terrifying crime, reminiscent of the work of serial killer Temple Gault, who has long eluded Dr. Kay Scarpetta and law enforcement for years.\u00a0Into this volatile atmosphere comes Scarpetta\u2019s ingenious, rebellious niece Lucy, an FBI intern with a promising future in Quantico\u2019s computer engineering facility\u2014until she is accused of a shocking security violation. While coming to terms with Lucy, Kay must conduct a grisly forensic investigation at a clandestine research facility in Tennessee known as The Body Farm. There she will find more answers to Emily Steiner\u2019s murder\u2014and evidence that paints a picture of a crime more horrifying than she ever imagined.</p>"
