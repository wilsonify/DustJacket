  "description": "<p><strong>Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this multi-million-copy</strong> New York Times <strong>bestseller is the definitive manual for anyone interested in gaining, observing, or defending against ultimate control \u2013 from the author of</strong> The Laws of Human Nature <strong>. This is the only authorized paperback edition in the US.<br />\n</strong><br />\nIn the book that <em>People</em> magazine proclaimed \u201cbeguiling\u201d and \u201cfascinating,\u201d Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.  </p>\n<p>Some laws teach the need for prudence (\u201cLaw 1: Never Outshine the Master\u201d), others teach the value of confidence (\u201cLaw 28: Enter Action with Boldness\u201d), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (\u201cLaw 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally\u201d). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package, <em>The 48 Laws of Power</em> is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.</p>"
