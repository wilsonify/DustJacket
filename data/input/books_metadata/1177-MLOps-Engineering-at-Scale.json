  "description": "<span><i>MLOps Engineering at Scale</i> teaches you how to implement efficient machine learning systems using pre-built services from AWS and other cloud vendors. This easy-to-follow book guides you step-by-step as you set up your serverless ML infrastructure, even if you\u2019ve never used a cloud platform before. You\u2019ll also explore tools like PyTorch Lightning, Optuna, and MLFlow that make it easy to build pipelines and scale your deep learning models in production.\n  \n  </span>"
