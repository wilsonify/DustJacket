  "description": "<p>In this provocative thriller, forensic expert Kay Scarpetta is surrounded by familiar faces, yet traveling down the unfamiliar road of fame....It is the week before Christmas. A tanking economy has prompted Dr. Kay Scarpetta\u2014despite her busy schedule and her continuing work as the senior forensic analyst for CNN\u2014to offer her services pro bono to New York City\u2019s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In no time at all, her increased visibility seems to precipitate a string of unexpected and unsettling events, culminating in an ominous package\u2014possibly a bomb\u2014showing up at the front desk of the apartment building where she and her husband, Benton, live. Soon the apparent threat on Scarpetta\u2019s life finds her embroiled in a surreal plot that includes a famous actor accused of an unthinkable sex crime and the disappearance of a beautiful millionaire with whom her niece, Lucy, seems to have shared a secret past. Scarpetta\u2019s CNN producer wants her to launch a TV show called The Scarpetta Factor. Given the bizarre events already in play, she fears that her growing fame will generate the illusion that she has a \u201cspecial factor,\u201d a mythical ability to solve all her cases. She wonders if she will end up like other TV personalities: her own stereotype.</p>"
