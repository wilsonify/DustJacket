  "description": "<div>\n<p>NOW A BLOCKBUSTER MOTION PICTURE DIRECTED BY CLINT EASTWOOD\u2014NOMINATED FOR SIX ACADEMY AWARDS, INCLUDING BEST PICTUREThis special enhanced edition features more than 10 exclusive videos with Chris Kyle and an additional 15 images and descriptions of the weapons used by the armed forces in their fight against terrorism overseas. </p>\n<p>From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy Seal Chris Kyle recorded the most career sniper kills in United States military history. His fellow American warriors, whom he protected with deadly precision from rooftops and stealth positions during the Iraq War, called him \u201cThe Legend\u201d; meanwhile, the enemy feared him so much they named him al-Shaitan (\u201cthe devil\u201d) and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle, who was tragically killed in 2013, writes honestly about the pain of war\u2014including the deaths of two close SEAL teammates\u2014and in moving first-person passages throughout, his wife, Taya, speaks openly about the strains of war on their family, as well as on Chris. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle\u2019s masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time. </p>\n<p>Please note that due to the large file size of these special features this enhanced e-book may take longer to download then a standard e-book.</p></div>"
