  "description": "<p>CREEPERS, David Morrell's gripping joyride of a thriller, depicts every harrowing second in eight hours of relentless terror. A New York Times bestseller, it received the prestigious Stoker Award from the Horror Writers Association.</p>\n\n<p>On a cold October night, five people gather in a run-down motel on the New Jersey shore and begin preparations to break in to the Paragon Hotel. Built in the glory days of Asbury Park by a reclusive millionaire, the magnificent structure\u2014which foreshadowed the beauties of art-deco architecture\u2014is now boarded up and marked for demolition.</p>\n\n<p>The five people are \"creepers,\" the slang term for urban explorers: city archeologists with a passion for investigating abandoned buildings and their dying secrets. On this evening, they are joined by a reporter who wants to profile them\u2014anonymously, as this is a highly illegal activity\u2014for a New York Times article.</p>\n\n<p>Frank Balenger isn't looking for just a story, however. And after the group enters the rat-infested tunnel leading to the hotel, it becomes clear that he will get much more than he bargained for. Danger, terror, and death await the creepers in a place ravaged by time and redolent of evil.</p>\n\n<p>The darkest secrets live in places you\u2019re not supposed to be.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cChilling.\u201d \u2014Stephen King, New York Times bestselling author of Doctor Sleep\u201cCrack this novel, and it\u2019s like an alien abduction of your brain\u2014forget resuming your normal life until it\u2019s finished. This will be a classic.\u201d\u2014Douglas Preston, New York Times bestselling co-author (with Lincoln Child) of White Fire\u201cWith its nonstop cascade of ingeniously contrived dangers and assaults, culminating in an apocalyptic finale, Creepers provides the essence of all thrillers, an intense emotional effect that will leave readers drained.\u201d\u2014Washington Post</p>"
