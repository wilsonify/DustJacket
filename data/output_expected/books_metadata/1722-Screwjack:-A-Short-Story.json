  "description": "SUMMARY:\nA searing and unnaturally poignant love story, as only Hunter S. Thompson could write it. \"Screwjack\" is simultaneously eerie and feverish, debauched and affecting. Never before - and perhaps never since - has modern man's melancholia been so vividly revealed in all its wanton glory."
