  "description": "<div> <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3> <div> <blockquote><i> \"When the Dark comes rising, six shall turn it back,<br> Three from the circle, three from the track;<br> Wood, bronze, iron; water, fire, stone;<br> Five will return, and one go alone.\"</i> </blockquote> With these mysterious words, Will Stanton discovers on his 11th birthday that he is no mere boy. He is the Sign-Seeker, last of the immortal Old Ones, destined to battle the powers of evil that trouble the land. His task is monumental: he must find and guard the six great Signs of the Light, which, when joined, will create a force strong enough to match and perhaps overcome that of the Dark. Embarking on this endeavor is dangerous as well as deeply rewarding; Will must work within a continuum of time and space much broader than he ever imagined.<p> Susan Cooper, in her five-title <i>The Dark Is Rising</i> is a Newbery Honor Book and a Carnegie Medal Honor Book. (Ages 8 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i> </p></div> <h3>Review</h3> <div> Psychology Today \"Susan Cooper is one of the few contemporary writers who has the vivid imagination, the narrative powers, and the moral vision that permit her to create the kind of sweeping conflict between good and evil that lies at the heart of all great fantasy. Tolkien had it. So did C.S. Lewis. And Cooper writes in the same tradition.\" -- <i>Review</i> </div> </div>"
