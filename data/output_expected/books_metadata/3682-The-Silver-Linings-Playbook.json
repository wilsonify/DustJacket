  "description": "<div><p>A heartwarming debut novel, soon to be a major movie by David O. Russell</p><p>\u201cAawww shucks!\u201d NPR's\u00a0Nancy Pearl said. \u201cI know that\u2019s hardly a usual way to begin a book review, but it was my immediate response to finishing Matthew Quick\u2019s heartwarming, humorous and soul-satisfying first novel . . . This book makes me smile.\u201d<br></p><p>Meet Pat Peoples. Pat has a theory: his life is a movie produced by God. And his God-given mission is to become physically fit and emotionally literate, whereupon God will ensure him a happy ending\u2014the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. (It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent several years in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat\u2019s now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he\u2019s being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he\u2019s being haunted by Kenny G!<br></p><p>David O. Russell, the Oscar-nominated director of <em>The Fighter</em>, is helming his own adaptation of <em>The Silver Linings Playbook</em>. Due in theaters this Thanksgiving, the movie features Bradley Cooper (<em>People</em> magazine\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive) in the role of Pat, alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Julia Stiles, Chris Tucker, and Jacki Weaver. As the award-winning novelist Justin Cronin put it: \u201cTender, soulful, hilarious, and true, <em>The Silver Linings Playbook</em> is a wonderful debut.\u201d</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Pat Peoples, the endearing narrator of this touching and funny debut, is down on his luck. The former high school history teacher has just been released from a mental institution and placed in the care of his mother. Not one to be discouraged, Pat believes he has only been on the inside for a few months\u2013\u2013rather than four years\u2013\u2013and plans on reconciling with his estranged wife. Refusing to accept that their apart time is actually a permanent separation, Pat spends his days and nights feverishly trying to become the man she had always desired. Our hapless hero makes a friend in Tiffany, the mentally unstable, widowed sister-in-law of his best friend, Ronnie. Each day as Pat heads out for his 10-mile run, Tiffany silently trails him, refusing to be shaken off by the object of her affection. The odd pair try to navigate a timid friendship, but as Pat is unable to discern friend from foe and reality from deranged optimism, every day proves to be a cringe-worthy adventure. Pat is as sweet as a puppy, and his offbeat story has all the markings of a crowd-pleaser. <em>(Sept.)</em> <br>Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
