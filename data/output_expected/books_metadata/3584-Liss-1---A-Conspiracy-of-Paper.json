  "description": "<p class=\"description\">Benjamin Weaver investigates a crime of the most personal sort: the mysterious death of his estranged father, a notorious stockjobber. To find the answers, Weaver must contend with a desperate prostitute who knows too much about his past, and relatives who remind him of his alienation from the Jewish faith. He uncovers the beginnings of a strange new economic order based on stock speculation, a way of life that poses great risk for investors but real danger for Weaver and his family.</p>"
