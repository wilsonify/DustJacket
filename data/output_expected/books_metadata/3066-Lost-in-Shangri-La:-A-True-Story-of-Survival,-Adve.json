  "description": "<div><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><em>Lost in Shangri-La</em>, Mitchell Zuckoff\u2019s remarkable and inspiring narrative. Faced with the potential brutality of the Dani tribe, known throughout the valley for its violence, the trio\u2019s lives were dependent on an unprecedented rescue mission--a dedicated group of paratroopers jumped into the jungle to provide aid and medical care, consequently leaving the survivors and paratroopers alike trapped on the jungle floor. A perilous rescue by plane became their only possible route to freedom. A riveting story of deliverance under the most unlikely circumstances, <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em> deserves its place among the great survival stories of World War II. <em>--Lynette Mong</em></p><hr><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: Hampton Sides Reviews <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em> </strong> </p><p><strong><em>Outside</em> magazine and the author of the international bestseller __, which won the 2002 PEN USA Award for nonfiction and the 2002 Discover Award from Barnes &amp; Noble, and also served as the basis for the 2005 Miramax film <em>The Great Raid</em>. </strong></p><hr><p>Although World War II was the greatest conflict in the history of this planet, many a jaded reader has come to the reluctant conclusion that there aren\u2019t any more World War II stories left to tell. At least not good ones\u2014not tales of the \u201cripping good yarn\u201d variety. Yet remarkably, in his new book <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em>, Mitchell Zuckoff has found one, and he\u2019s told it with reportorial verve, narrative skill, and exquisite pacing.</p><p>What makes this World War II story all the more fascinating is that it isn\u2019t really a war story\u2014not in a strict military sense. It\u2019s more of an exotic adventure tale with rich anthropological shadings. In 1945, near the end of the war, an American plane crashes in a hidden jungle valley in New Guinea inhabited by Stone Age cannibals. 21 Americans die in the crash, but three injured survivors soon find themselves stumbling through the jungle without food, nursing terrible wounds and trying to elude Japanese snipers known to be holding out in the mountains.</p><p>The first contact between the three Americans and the valley\u2019s Dani tribesmen is both poignant and comical. The Americans, Zuckoff writes, have \u201ccrash-landed in a world that time didn\u2019t forget. Time never knew it existed.\u201d The tribesmen, who have never encountered metal and have yet to master the concept of the wheel, think the American interlopers are white spirits who\u2019ve descended on a vine from heaven, fulfilling an ancient legend. They\u2019re puzzled and fascinated by the layers of \u201cremovable skin\u201d in which these alien visitors are wrapped; the natives, who smear their bodies in pig grease and cover their genitals with gourds, have never seen clothes before.</p><p>The Americans, in turn, are pretty sure their boartusk-bestudded hosts want to skewer them for dinner.</p><p>What ensues in Zuckoff\u2019s fine telling is not so much a cultural collision as a pleasing and sometimes hilarious mutual unraveling of assumptions. Though the differences in the two societies are chasmic, the Americans and the Dani become\u2014in a guarded, tentative sort of way\u2014_friends_.</p><p>But when armed American airmen arrive via parachute to rescue the survivors, relations become more tense. The Americans make their camp right in the middle of a no-man\u2019s land between warring Dani tribes\u2014a no-man\u2019s land where for centuries they have fought the battles that are central to their daily culture. Here, Zuckoff notes, the ironies are profoundly rich. The Dani, untouched by and indeed utterly unaware of the great war that\u2019s been raging all across the globe, become thoroughly discombobulated when their own war is temporarily disrupted.</p><p>Yes, there <em>are</em> still a few good World War II stories left to tell. And yes, this one meets all the requirements of a ripping good yarn. Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, is a first-rate reporter who has spared no expense to rescue this tale from obscurity. His story has it all: Tragedy, survival, comedy, an incredibly dangerous eleventh-hour rescue, and an immensely attractive heroine to boot. It\u2019s extraordinary that Hollywood hasn\u2019t already taken this tale and run wild with it. If it did, the resulting movie would be equal parts <em>Alive</em>, <em>Cast Away</em>, and <em>The Gods Must Be Crazy</em>. It\u2019s as though the Americans have arrived in the Stone Age through a wormhole in the space-time continuum. The Dani don\u2019t know what to do with themselves\u2014and life, as any of us know it, will never be the same.</p><hr><h3>Review</h3><p>\u201cZuckoff transforms impressive research into a deft narrative that brings the saga of the survivors to life.\u201d (Publishers Weekly (starred review) ) </p><p>\u201cZuckoff delivers a remarkable survival story. . . .
