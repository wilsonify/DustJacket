  "description": "<div>\n<p>Technology is revolutionizing the way real estate is designed, operated, and valued. It is democratizing access to capital and information, changing the way tenants use space, and eroding the power of regulation. Billions of dollars are funding these new real estate technologies and operating models. Value is shifting away from the assets themselves toward those who understand the needs of specific end-users and can use technology to deliver comprehensive, on-demand solutions. With all of these developments, there is an urgent need for a resource that helps industry practitioners think differently about their investment, customers, and competition. </p>\n<p>Rethinking Real Estate answers that call. It explores the impact of technology on all asset types \u2014 from retail projects, through lodging and residential properties, to office buildings and industrial facilities. Based on the author\u2019s two decades of experience working across four continents alongside the world\u2019s leading real estate investors, as well as hundreds of conversations with start-up founders and venture capitalists, this book provides practitioners with key insights, methodologies, and practical strategies to identify risks, take advantage of emerging opportunities, evaluate new competitors, and transform their organization, project, venture, or career. Whether you are an investor, developer, operator, broker, lender, facility manager, designer, planner, or technology entrepreneur, this book will help you navigate the exciting period ahead.</p></div>"
