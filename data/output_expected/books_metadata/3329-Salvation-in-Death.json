  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: **Ancient church rituals meet cutting- edge crime solving in the latest novel in the #1 *New York Times*\u2013bestselling series that\u2019s \u201c*Law & Order: SVU*\u2014in the future\u201d (*Entertainment Weekly*)**. *In the year 2060, sophisticated investigative tools can help catch a killer. But there are some questions even the most advanced technologies cannot answer.* Ridley Pearson has praised J. D. Robb\u2019s suspense as \u201ctaut\u201d and \u201cnerve-jangling.\u201d Her latest thriller sets a new standard for suspense, as the priest at a Catholic funeral mass brings the chalice to his lips\u2014and falls over dead. When Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas confirms that the consecrated wine contained potassium cyanide, she\u2019s determined to solve the murder of Father Miguel Flores, despite her discomfort with her surroundings. It\u2019s not the bodegas and pawnshops of East Harlem that bother her, though the neighborhood is a long way from the stone mansion she shares with her billionaire husband, Roarke. It\u2019s all that holiness flying around at St. Christobal\u2019s that makes her uneasy. A search of the victim\u2019s sparsely furnished room reveals little\u2014 except for a carefully hidden religious medal with a mysterious inscription, and a couple of underlined Bible passages. The autopsy reveals more: faint scars of knife wounds, a removed tattoo\u2014and evidence of plastic surgery, suggesting that \u201cFather Flores\u201d may not have been the man his parishioners had thought. Now, as Eve pieces together clues that hint at gang connections and a deeply personal act of revenge, she believes she\u2019s making progress on the case. Until a second murder\u2014in front of an even larger crowd of worshippers\u2014knocks the whole investigation sideways. And Eve is left to figure out who committed these unholy acts\u2014and why."
