  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: Collected here for the first time in a deluxe paperback volume are six of John Steinbeck's most widely read and beloved novels-*Tortilla Flat, The Red Pony, Of Mice and Men, The Moon Is Down, Cannery Row*, and *The Pearl*. From Steinbeck's tale of commitment, loneliness, and hope in *Of Mice and Men*, to his tough yet charming portrait of people on the margins of society in *Cannery Row,* to *The Pearl'*s examination of the fallacy of the American dream, Steinbeck created stories that were realistic, rugged, and imbued with energy and resilience."
