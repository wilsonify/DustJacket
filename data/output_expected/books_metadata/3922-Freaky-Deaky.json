  "description": "<p>An explosive thriller from the 'greatest living writer of crime fiction' [NEW YORK TIMES].Way back when revolution was the thing, bombs were Robin Abbott and Skip Gibbs's bag - until they were sent to prison. Now they're out and looking to put their skills to profitable use. Their target: Woody Ricks - who Robin thinks ratted them out to the Feds. But Motown cop Chris Mankowski has his eye on Woody, and as a former golden boy of the bomb squad, it's only fitting he'll be around when the nasty stuff starts going down\u00bf or blowing up.</p>"
