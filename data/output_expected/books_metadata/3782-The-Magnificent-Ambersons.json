Barnes &amp; Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Largely overshadowed by Orson Welles\u2019s famous 1941 screen version, Booth Tarkington\u2019s novel The Magnificent Ambersons was not only a best-seller when it first appeared in 1918\u2014it also won the Pulitzer Prize.Set in the Midwest in the early twentieth century\u2014the dawn of the automobile age\u2014the novel begins by introducing the richest family in town, the Ambersons. Exemplifying aristocratic excess, the Ambersons have everything money can buy\u2014and more. But George Amberson Minafer\u2014the spoiled grandson of the family patriarch\u2014is unable to see that great societal changes are taking place, and that business tycoons, industrialists, and real estate developers will soon surpass him in wealth and prestige. Rather than join the new mechanical age, George prefers to remain a gentleman, believing that \u201cbeing things\u201d is superior to \u201cdoing things.\u201d But as his town becomes a city, and the family palace is enveloped in a cloud of soot, George\u2019s protectors disappear one by one, and the elegant, cloistered lifestyle of the Ambersons fades from view, and finally vanishes altogether.A brilliant portrayal of the changing landscape of the American dream, The Magnificent Ambersons is a timeless classic that deserves a wider modern audience.
