I get excessively drunk at inappropriate times, disregard social norms, indulge every whim, ignore the consequences of my actions, mock idiots and posers, sleep with more women than is safe or reasonable, and just generally act like a raging dickhead. But, I do contribute to humanity in one very important way: I share my adventures with the world. \u2014from the Introduction   Actual reader feedback:     </p>\n<p class=\"description\">\"I am completely baffled as to how you can congratulate yourself for being a womanizer and a raging drunk, or think anyone cares about an idiot like you. Do you really think that exploiting the insecurities of others while getting wasted is a legitimate thing to offer?\"     </p>\n<p class=\"description\">\"Thank you, thank you, thank you\u2014for sharing with us your wonderful tales of drunken revelry, for teaching me what it means to be a man, for just existing so I know that there is another option; I too can say \u2018screw the system\u2019 and be myself and have fun. My life truly began when I finished reading your stories. Now, when faced with a quandary about what course of action I should take, I just ask myself, \u2018What Would Tucker Do?\u2019\u2014and I do it, and I am a better man for it.\"     </p>\n<p class=\"description\">\"I find it truly appalling that there are people in the world like you. You are a disgusting, vile, repulsive, repugnant, foul creature. Because of you, I don\u2019t believe in God anymore. No just God would allow someone like you to exist.\"     </p>\n<p class=\"description\">\"I\u2019ll stay with God as my lord, but you are my savior. I just finished reading your brilliant stories, and I laughed so hard I almost vomited. I want to bring that kind of joy to people. You\u2019re an artist of the highest order and a true humanitarian to boot. I'm in both shock and awe at how much I want to be you.\"     </p>\n<p class=\"description\">\"You are the coolest person I can even imagine existing. If you slept with my girlfriend, it'd make me love her more.\"</p></div>"
