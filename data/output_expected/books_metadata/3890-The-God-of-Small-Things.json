  "description": "<p>In this, the sequel to the successful The Truth Tells Twice, Charlie Allan continues the wonderful story of his family farm and surrounding community in the North-east of Scotland, as the running of the farm comes under his guidance. Filled with the same warmth and humor as its prequel, Them That Live the Longest explores the changing face of farming in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as examining the varied life of Charlie Allan himself\u2014from teaching economics in Glasgow, Strathclyde and St Andrews Universities to competing around the world as a Highland Games athlete, song-writing, publishing several books, and a five year stint as a producer-presenter with the BBC, turning his hand to the running of the farm and his eventual hand-over to the next generation. It is a lively, fresh and vivid account, joyous and absorbing and is sure to become a household favorite.</p>"
