  "description": "<div><p class=\"description\">SUMMARY:</p><p class=\"description\">First comes love. Then comes marriage. And then things start to get really interesting...  </p><p class=\"description\">Rebecca Rothstein-Rabinowitz is a plump, sexy chef who has a wonderful husband, supportive friends, a restaurant that's received citywide acclaim, a beautiful baby girl...and the mother-in-law from hell.  </p><p class=\"description\">Kelly Day's life looks picture-perfect. But behind the doors of her largely empty apartment, she's struggling to balance work and motherhood and marriage, while entering Oliver's every move (and movement) on a spreadsheet, and dealing with an unemployed husband who seems content to channel-surf for eight hours a day.  </p><p class=\"description\">And Ayinde Towne is already on shaky ground, trying to live her life to the letter of a how-to guide called \"Baby Success, \" when her basketball superstar husband breaks her trust at the most vulnerable moment in her life, putting their marriage in peril -- and their new family even more in the public eye.  </p><p class=\"description\">Then there's Lia Frederick, a Philadelphia native who has just come home, leaving Los Angeles behind, along with her glamorous Hollywood career, her husband, and a tragic secret, to start her life all over again.  </p><p class=\"description\">With her trademark warmth and humor, Weiner tells the story of what happens after happily ever after...and how an eight-pound bundle of joy can shake up every woman's sense of herself in the world around her.</p></div>"
