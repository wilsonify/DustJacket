  "description": "<div>\n<p>2020 ALA Alex Award Winner 2020 Stonewall \u2014 Israel Fishman Non-fiction Award Honor BookIn 2014, Maia Kobabe, who uses e/em/eir pronouns, thought that a comic of reading statistics would be the last autobiographical comic e would ever write. At the time, it was the only thing e felt comfortable with strangers knowing about em. Now, Gender Queer is here. Maia\u2019s intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma and fundamental violation of pap smears. Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity\u2014what it means and how to think about it\u2014for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere. \"It\u2019s also a great resource for those who identify as nonbinary or asexual as well as for those who know someone who identifies that way and wish to better understand. </p>\n<p>\" \u2014 SLJ (starred review)</p></div>"
