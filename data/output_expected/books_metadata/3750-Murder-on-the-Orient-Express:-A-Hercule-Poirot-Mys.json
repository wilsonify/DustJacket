  "description": "SUMMARY: One of Agatha Christie\u2019s most famous mysteries, Murder on the Orient Express was inspired by two real-life crimes and the author\u2019s own experience being stranded on the Orient Express during Christmas of 1931. While traveling to Paris, a wealthy American is stabbed to death in his cabin on the Orient Express. With the train stuck in a snowdrift, there is no easy escape for the killer. Fortunately, detective Hercule Poirot is aboard and launches a clever investigation into the curious assortment of passengers, of whom each seems to have a motive."
