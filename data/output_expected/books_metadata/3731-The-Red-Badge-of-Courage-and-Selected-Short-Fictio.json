Young Henry Fleming dreams of finding glory and honor as a Union soldier in the American Civil War. Yet he also harbors a hidden fear about how he may react when the horror and bloodshed of battle begin. Fighting the enemy without and the terror within, Fleming must prove himself and find his own meaning of valor. Unbelievable as it may seem, **Stephen Crane** had never been a member of any army nor had taken part in any battle when he wrote *The Red Badge of Courage*. But upon its publication in 1895, when Crane was only twenty-four, Red Badge was heralded as a new kind of war novel, marked by astonishing insight into the true psychology of men under fire. Along with the seminal short stories included in this volume\u2014\u201cThe Open Boat,\u201d \u201cThe Veteran,\u201d and \u201cThe Men in the Storm\u201d\u2014*The Red Badge of Courage* unleashed Crane\u2019s deeply influential impressionistic style. **Richard Fusco** has been an Assistant Professor of English at Saint Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia since 1997. A specialist in nineteenth-century American literature and in short-story narrative theory, he has published on a variety of American, British, and Continental literary figures."
