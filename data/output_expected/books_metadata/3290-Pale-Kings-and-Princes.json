  "description": "<p>\u201cEbullient entertainment.\u201d\u2014Time A hotshot reporter is dead. He'd gone to take a look-see at \u201cMiami North\u201d\u2014little Wheaton, Massachusetts\u2014the biggest cocaine distribution center above the Mason-Dixon line. Did the kid die for getting too close to the truth . . . or to a sweet lady with a jealous husband? Spenser will stop at nothing to find out.</p>\n\n<p>Praise for Robert B. Parker's Spenser novels \u201cLike Philip Marlowe, Spenser is a man of honor in a dishonorable world. When he says he will do something, it is done. The dialogues zings, and there is plenty of action . . . but it is the moral element that sets them above most detective fiction.\u201d\u2014Newsweek\u201cCrackling dialogue, plenty of action and expert writing . . . Unexpectedly literate\u2014[Spenser is] in many respects the very exemplar of the species.\u201d\u2014The New York Times \u00a0 \u201cThey just don\u2019t make private eyes tougher or funnier.\u201d\u2014People \u00a0 \u201cParker has a recorder\u2019s ear for dialogue, an agile wit . . . and, strangely enough, a soup\u00e7on of compassion hidden under that sardonic, flip exterior.\u201d\u2014Los Angeles Times \u00a0 \u201cA deft storyteller, a master of pace.\u201d\u2014The Philadelphia Inquirer \u00a0 \u201cSpenser probably had more to do with changing the private eye from a coffin-chaser to a full-bodied human being than any other detective hero.\u201d\u2014The Chicago Sun-Times \u00a0 \u201c[Spenser is] tough, intelligent, wisecracking, principled, and brave.\u201d\u2014The New Yorker</p>"
