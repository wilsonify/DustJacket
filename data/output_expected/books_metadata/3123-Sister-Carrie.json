  "description": "SUMMARY: This epic of urban life tells of small- town heroine Carrie Meeber, adrift in an indifferent Chicago. Setting out, she has nothing but a few dollars and an unspoiled beauty. Hers is a story of struggle-from sweatshop to stage success-and of the love she inspires in an older, married man whose obsession with her threatens to destroy him."
