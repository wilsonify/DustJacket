  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: There are many editions of Treasure Island. This educational edition was created for self-improvement or in preparation for advanced examinations. The bottom of each page is annotated with a mini-thesaurus of uncommon words highlighted in the text, including synonyms and antonyms. Designed for school districts, educators, and students seeking to maximize performance on standardized tests, Webster\u2019s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings. A running thesaurus at the bottom of each page is useful to students who are actively building their vocabularies in anticipation of taking PSAT\u00ae, SAT\u00ae, AP\u00ae (Advanced Placement\u00ae), GRE\u00ae, LSAT\u00ae, GMAT\u00ae or similar examinations. This edition exposes the reader to a maximum number of \u201cdifficult, and often encountered\u201d words in examinations. Rather than supply a single synonym, many are provided for a variety of meanings, allowing readers to better grasp the ambiguity of the English language, and avoid using the notes as a pure crutch. Having the reader decipher a word\u2019s meaning within context serves to improve vocabulary retention and understanding. Each page covers words not already highlighted on previous pages.
