  "description": "<div><h3><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px; \"><b><u>Fantasy Masterworks Volume 5</u></b></span></h3><h3>Review</h3><p>''A book that all by itself calls for a redefinition of fantasy.'' --Ursula K. Le Guin<br></p><p>''Crowley is generous, obsessed, fascinating, gripping. Really, I think Crowley is so good that he has left everybody else in the dust.'' --Peter Straub, award-winning horror fiction author<br></p><p>Ambitious, dazzling, strangely moving, a marvelous magic-realist family chronicle.'' --<em>Washington Post</em><br></p><p>''John Crowley writes sentences of such coruscating magnificence that the rest of the English language has fallen in love with them. I once knew an adverbial clause who was so infatuated with the linguistic beauty of <em>Little, Big</em> that the poor creature pined away into a comma.'' --James Morrow, World Fantasy Award-winning author<br></p><p>''One of my favorite works of modern fantasy, <em>Little, Big</em>, is an amazing tale told in an amazing way. Reading it I felt as if I were watching a high-wire artist: one slip and he would fall into the dreadful net of Twee. Yet Crowley never slips, not upon a single word, and the book grows more powerful with every page.'' --Katharine Kerr, bestselling author </p><h3>Product Description</h3><p>John Crowley's masterful <em>Little, Big</em> is the epic story of Smoky Barnable, an anonymous young man who travels by foot from the City to a place called Edgewood\u2014not found on any map\u2014to marry Daily Alice Drinkawater, as was prophesied. It is the story of four generations of a singular family, living in a house that is many houses on the magical border of an otherworld. It is a story of fantastic love and heartrending loss; of impossible things and unshakable destinies; and of the great Tale that envelops us all. It is a wonder. </p></div>"
