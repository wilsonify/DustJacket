And third chances? In fact an infinite number of chances to live your life? Would you eventually be able to save the world from its own inevitable destiny? And would you even want to?</p><p><em>Life After Life </em>follows Ursula Todd as she lives through the turbulent events of the last century again and again.

Here she is at her most profound and inventive, in a novel that celebrates the best and worst of ourselves.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>PRAISE FOR <em>LIFE AFTER LIFE</em>:<br></p><p>\"Kate Atkinson is a marvel. There aren't enough breathless adjectives to describe Life After Life: Dazzling, witty, moving, joyful, mournful, profound. Wildly inventive, deeply felt. Hilarious. Humane. Simply put: It's one of the best novels I've read this century.\" (<strong>Gillian Flynn, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller *Gone Girl</strong>* )<br></p><p>\"<em>Life After Life</em> is a masterpiece about how even the smallest choices can sometimes change the course of history. It's wise, bittersweet, funny, and unlike anything else you've ever read. Kate Atkinson is one of my all-time favorite novelists, and I believe this is her best book yet.\" (<strong>J. Courtney Sullivan, bestselling author of <em>Maine</em> and *Commencement</strong>* ) </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Kate Atkinson's first novel, <em>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</em>, was named the UK's Whitbread Book of the Year in 1995. Since then, she has written seven more ground-breaking, bestselling books, most recently <em>Started Early, Took My Dog. </em>She lives in Edinburgh. </p></div>"
