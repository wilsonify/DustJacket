  "description": "<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2011</strong>: <em>The Snowman</em>, Norwegian author Jo Nesb\u00f8's thriller, should please even the most die-hard Stieg Larsson fans. On the first day of snow, a child wakes up to find his mother has disappeared during the night. Outside, a snowman has appeared out of nowhere, the calling card of one of the most terrifying serial killers in recent fiction. A letter from the perpetrator draws Detective Hole further and further into the case, and together with his new partner, Katrine Bratt, he hunts the Snowman through twists and turns that become increasingly personal and may drive Hole to the brink of insanity. Brilliantly crafted, this credible and dark page-turner fully fleshes out the characters, especially Hole, a hardened detective with sharp instincts and real heart. What is the link between the victims? Is the Snowman a suspicious doctor, a notorious playboy, or one of Hole's peers on the force? The police keep thinking they've caught the criminal, but Hole's astute observations may steer him around the red herrings and right into the hands of the cold-as-ice killer. <em>--Miriam Landis</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p>\u201cJo Nesb\u00f8 is my new favorite thriller writer and Harry Hole my new hero.\u201d \u2014Michael Connelly </p>"
