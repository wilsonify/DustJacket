  "description": "SUMMARY: Every schoolchild learns about the mutually beneficial dance of honeybees and flowers: The bee collects nectar and pollen to make honey and, in the process, spreads the flowers\u2019 genes far and wide. In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires\u2014sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control\u2014with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind\u2019s most basic yearnings. And just as we\u2019ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?"
