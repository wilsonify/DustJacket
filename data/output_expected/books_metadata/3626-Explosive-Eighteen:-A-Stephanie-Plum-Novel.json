  "description": "<p class=\"description\">Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum\u2019s life is set to blow sky high when international murder hits dangerously close to home, in this dynamite novel by Janet Evanovich. Before Stephanie can even step foot off Flight 127 Hawaii to Newark, she\u2019s knee deep in trouble. Her dream vacation turned into a nightmare, and she\u2019s flying back to New Jersey solo. Worse still, her seatmate never returned to the plane after the L.A. layover. Now he\u2019s dead, in a garbage can, waiting for curbside pickup. His killer could be anyone. And a ragtag collection of thugs and psychos, not to mention the FBI, are all looking for a photograph the dead man was supposed to be carrying. Only one other person has seen the missing photo\u2014Stephanie Plum. Now she\u2019s the target, and she doesn\u2019t intend to end up in a garbage can. With the help of an FBI sketch artist Stephanie re-creates the person in the photo. Unfortunately the first sketch turns out to look like Tom Cruise, and the second sketch like Ashton Kutcher. Until Stephanie can improve her descriptive skills, she\u2019ll need to watch her back. Over at the bail bonds agency things are going from bad to worse. The bonds bus serving as Vinnie\u2019s temporary HQ goes up in smoke. Stephanie\u2019s wheelman, Lula, falls in love with their largest skip yet. Lifetime arch nemesis Joyce Barnhardt moves into Stephanie\u2019s apartment. And everyone wants to know what happened in Hawaii? Morelli, Trenton\u2019s hottest cop, isn\u2019t talking about Hawaii. Ranger, the man of mystery, isn\u2019t talking about Hawaii. And all Stephanie is willing to say about her Hawaiian vacation is . . . It\u2019s complicated.</p>"
