  "description": "<p>The inspiration for the Prime Video series Scarpetta\u2014starring Nicole Kidman and Jamie Lee Curtis! Discover the \u201cdazzling...fascinating\u201d (Los Angeles Times) novel that launched the popular Kay Scarpetta series, from the New York Times #1 bestselling crime writer Patricia Cornwell.</p>\n\n<p>Patricia Cornwell\u2019s debut novel Postmortem introduces one of crime fiction\u2019s most compelling characters: gutsy medical examiner Kay Scarpetta. Cornwell\u2019s gift for combining cutting-edge criminology with nerve-shattering suspense makes this book a true modern classic. Under cover of night in Richmond, Virginia, a monster strikes, leaving a gruesome trail of stranglings that has paralyzed the city. Kay Scarpetta suspects the worst: a deliberate campaign by a brilliant serial killer whose signature offers precious few clues. With an unerring eye, she calls on the latest advances in forensic research to unmask the madman. But this investigation will test Kay like no other, because it\u2019s being sabotaged from within\u2014and someone wants her dead.</p>"
