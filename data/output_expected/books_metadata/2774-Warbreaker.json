  "description": "<p>From the author of the connected universe of the Cosmere comes the standalone novel from which spring characters who later play roles in the #1 New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive.</p>\n\n<p>In the world of Warbreaker, each person is born endowed with the power of one Breath\u2015which can be sold and collected by others, then used to Awaken objects and even corpses to do their bidding. A few individuals who die in glory return as gods, with the power of thousands of Breath, but no memory of their mortal lives\u2015and are enthroned in the Court of Gods in Hallandren\u2019s capital. To Vivenna and Siri, princesses of Idris, the abuse of Breath and the claim of the Returned to be gods are repugnant blasphemy. But with one princess wed to the God King of their nation\u2019s enemies in a bid for peace, the other finds she must rely on Breath-using mercenaries to try to rescue her sister from her monstrous husband.</p>\n\n<p>Lightsong the Bold, a lesser god who doubts his own religion, starts investigating mysterious murders in the Court of Gods and uncovers haunting clues to his own forgotten past. He is one of four gods who controls the army of Awakened Lifeless soldiers, and one faction is inciting an invasion of Idris despite the marriage treaty. Vasher\u2015wielder of the sapient sword Nightblood\u2015works behind the scenes against the declaration of war, but Lightsong\u2019s visions of bloodshed prophesy its inevitability. Can the new queen, unaware of her sister\u2019s imminent rescue attempt, persuade Lightsong and also somehow get through to the aloof God King\u2015who she has been forbidden to speak to or even look in the eyes\u2015before her homeland is destroyed?Other Tor books by Brandon SandersonThe CosmereThe Stormlight Archive\u25cf The Way of Kings\u25cf Words of Radiance\u25cf Edgedancer (novella)\u25cf Oathbringer\u25cf Dawnshard (novella)\u25cf Rhythm of WarThe Mistborn SagaThe Original Trilogy\u25cf Mistborn\u25cf The Well of Ascension\u25cf The Hero of AgesWax &amp; Wayne\u25cf The Alloy of Law\u25cf Shadows of Self\u25cf The Bands of Mourning\u25cf The Lost MetalOther Cosmere novels\u25cf Elantris\u25cf Warbreaker\u25cf Tress of the Emerald Sea\u25cf Yumi and the Nightmare Painter\u25cf The Sunlit ManCollection\u25cf Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere CollectionAlcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians\u25cf Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians\u25cf The Scrivener's Bones\u25cf The Knights of Crystallia\u25cf The Shattered Lens\u25cf The Dark Talent\u25cf Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians (with Janci Patterson)Other novels\u25cf The Rithmatist\u25cf Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds\u25cf The Frugal Wizard\u2019s Handbook for Surviving Medieval EnglandOther books by Brandon SandersonThe Reckoners\u25cf Steelheart\u25cf Firefight\u25cf Calamity\u25cf Lux (with Steven Michael Bohls)Skyward\u25cf Skyward\u25cf Starsight\u25cf Cytonic\u25cf Skyward Flight (with Janci Patterson)\u25cf Defiant</p>"
