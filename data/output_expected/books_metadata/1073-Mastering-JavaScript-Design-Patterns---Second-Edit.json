  "description": "<div>\n<p>Write reliable code to create powerful applications by mastering advanced JavaScript design patterns About This Book Learn how to use tried and true software design methodologies to enhance your JavaScript code Discover robust JavaScript implementations of classic and advanced design patterns Packed with easy-to-follow examples that can be used to create reusable code and extensible designs Who This Book Is For This book is ideal for JavaScript developers who want to gain expertise in object-oriented programming with JavaScript and the new capabilities of ES-2015 to improve their web development skills and build professional-quality web applications. What You Will Learn Harness the power of patterns for tasks ranging from application building to code testing Rethink and revitalize your code with the use of functional patterns Improve the way you organize your code Build large-scale apps seamlessly with the help of reactive patterns Identify the best use cases for microservices Get to grips with creational, behavioral, and structural design patterns Explore advanced design patterns including dependency injection In Detail With the recent release of ES-2015, there are several new object-oriented features and functions introduced in JavaScript. These new features enhance the capabilities of JavaScript to utilize design patterns and software design methodologies to write powerful code. Through this book, you will explore how design patterns can help you improve and organize your JavaScript code. You'll get to grips with creational, structural and behavioral patterns as you discover how to put them to work in different scenarios. Then, you'll get a deeper look at patterns used in functional programming, as well as model view patterns and patterns to build web applications. This updated edition will also delve into reactive design patterns and microservices as they are a growing phenomenon in the world of web development. You will also find patterns to improve the testability of your code using mock objects, mocking frameworks, and monkey patching. We'll also show you some advanced patterns including dependency injection and live post processing. By the end of the book, you'll be saved of a lot of trial and error and developmental headaches, and you will be on the road to becoming a JavaScript expert. Style and approach Packed with several real-world use cases, this book shows you through step-by-step instructions how to implement the advanced objec...</p></div>"
