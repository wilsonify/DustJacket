  "description": "<p>Even before A Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin had already established himself as a giant in the field of fantasy literature. The first of two stunning collections, Dreamsongs: Volume I is a rare treat for readers, offering fascinating insight into his journey from young writer to award-winning master. \u00a0 Gathered here in Dreamsongs: Volume I are the very best of George R. R. Martin\u2019s early works, including his Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker award\u2013winning stories, cool fan pieces, and the original novella The Ice Dragon, from which Martin\u2019s New York Times bestselling children\u2019s book of the same title originated. A dazzling array of subjects and styles that features extensive author commentary, Dreamsongs, Volume I is the perfect collection for both Martin devotees and a new generation of fans. \u00a0 \u201cFans, genre historians and aspiring writers alike will find this shelf-bending retrospective as impressive as it is intriguing.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly \u00a0 \u201cDreamsongs is the ideal way to discover . . . a master of science fiction, fantasy and horror. . . .
