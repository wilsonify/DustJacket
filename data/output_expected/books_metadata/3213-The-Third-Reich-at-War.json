  "description": "<div><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p><p><strong> An absorbing, revelatory, and definitive account of one of the greatest tragedies in human history </strong></p><p>Adroitly blending narrative, description, and analysis, Richard J. Evans portrays a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. Interweaving a broad narrative of the war's progress from a wide range of people, Evans reveals the dynamics of a society plunged into war at every level. The great battles and events of the conflict are here, but just as telling is Evans's re- creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermi\u00adnation of the Jews. The final book in Richard J. Evans's three-volume history of Hitler's Germany, hailed \"a masterpiece\" by <em>The New York Times, The Third Reich at War</em> lays bare the most momentous and tragic years of the Nazi regime.</p><p><strong>The Washington Post - Benjamin Carter Hett:</strong></p><p>Evans is clearly up on all the latest research on Nazi Germany, no mean achievement in a field in which tens of thousands of books have been published. But his goal is to appeal to the general reader rather than the professional historian, and he succeeds brilliantly, producing a book that is beautifully written and, despite its length and grim subject matter, easily digestible, even gripping...This is history in the grand style, the kind of large-scale narrative that few historians dare to write these days. It is difficult to imagine how it could be improved upon, let alone surpassed.</p><p><strong>Biography:</strong></p><p><strong>Richard J. Evans</strong> is Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. His previous books include <em>In Defense of History, Lying About Hitler</em>, and the companions to this title, <em>The Coming of the Third Reich</em> and <em>The Third Reich in Power</em>.</p></div>"
