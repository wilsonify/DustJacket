  "description": "<div><p>His two previous novels, <em>Every Dead Thing and Dark Hollow,</em> were international bestsellers. Now the \"compulsively readable\" <em>(Publishers Weekly)</em> John Connolly confirms his position as one of our leading crime novelists with a story of superb menace and style. </p><p>The body of Grace Peltier, a brilliant Ph.D. candidate, is found in the front seat of her car on a back road in northern Maine. No one wants to believe it was suicide -- not her father, not former U.S. senator Jack Mercier, and not private detective Charlie Parker, who has been hired to investigate the young woman's untimely death. </p><p>But when a mass grave is accidentally discovered nearby, revealing the grim truth behind the disappearance of a religious community known as the Aroostook Baptists, Parker realizes that their deaths and the violent passing of Grace Peltier are part of the same mystery, one that has its roots in her family history and in the origins of the shadowy organization known as the Fellowship. Soon Parker is drawn into the dark world of this zealous religious group that has already consumed every person who has dared confront it. When a relic is discovered, one capable of linking the Fellowship to the slaughter of the Aroostook Baptists, Parker is forced into violent conflict with the Fellowship and its enigmatic leader. Haunted by the ghost of a small boy and tormented by the demonic killer known as Mr. Pudd, Parker is forced to fight for his lover, his friends...and his very soul. </p><p>\"This is a honeycomb world. It hides a hollow heart,\" writes John Connolly. In <em>The Killing Kind,</em> he has once again created a world of love and hate, of tenderness and violence. Hailed by critics as \"one of the best of the genre\" <em>(Toronto Sun),</em> his intense, poetic prose and his terrifying clan of characters are sure to thrill even the most discerning suspense reader.</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Move over, Spider-Man. Arachnophobes, proceed at your own peril. Elias Pudd, the archfiend in Connolly's masterful third suspense novel (following Every Dead Thing and Dark Hollow) finds such grizzly uses for spiders of all, er, stripes that he makes that dastardly villain Hannibal Lecter seem like Little Lord Fauntleroy. Pudd, however, is just one in a splendidly drawn cast that propels this gripping, intricately plotted tale. When a road crew in northern Maine accidentally unearths a grave site, the bodies turn out to be members of the Aroostook Baptists, a cultlike religious group whose members disappeared in the 1960s. Meanwhile, private investigator Charlie Parker (from the earlier novels) is hired to investigate the suspicious suicide of Grace Peltier, who was working on a graduate thesis concerning-guess what?-the Aroostook Baptists. Further muddying the waters is the Fellowship, a group led by the supremely unctuous Carter Paragon (nee Chester Quincy Deedes, \"the name on his birth certificate and his criminal record\"), which turns out to be far more sinister than anyone realized. From Connolly's opening words-\"This is a honeycomb world. It hides a hollow heart\"-it's clear that this is no ordinary thriller; indeed, his random musings on the manifestations of evil, coupled with Parker's visions and flashbacks, lend the book a dark, intriguing overlay. Lest things become too intense, however, the author's wry sense of humor easily lightens the situation, often harking back to earlier noir writers: \"she had the kind of body that caused highway pileups after Sunday services.\" In his novel's acknowledgments, Connolly modestly writes, \"As each novel progresses, the depths of my ignorance become more and more apparent.\" Also becoming more apparent are the depths of this author's psychological acumen, literary skills and prodigious creativity.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p><h3>From Library Journal</h3><p>After Every Dead Thing and Dark Hollow, Connolly's damaged P.I. Charlie Parker is back in his third foray into an underworld populated with cruel villains and criminal psychopaths. Parker is a singularly tortured individual who not only sees dead people but feels compelled to seek retribution for their deaths on their behalf. This time around, he is hired to find the killer of a graduate student who had been researching a fundamentalist sect that disappeared into the backwoods of Maine 40 years before. Parker's investigations, ranging from Maine to New York City, draw the ire of some very bad people, who come after him armed with guns, Bibles, and spiders. The Dublin-based Connolly has again written a compelling story full of sadistic bad guys, moral ambiguity, and some serious violence. But he manages to offset some of the unpleasantness with occasional one-liners that manage not to minimize the perversity but make the characters who must deal with it seem more human.
