Never anger old people. And don\u2019t do what Tiki tells you to do. </strong><br><strong>\u00a0</strong><br>After a slow summer of chasing low-level skips for her cousin Vinnie\u2019s bail bonds agency, Stephanie Plum finally lands an assignment that could put her checkbook back in the black. Geoffrey Cubbin, facing trial for embezzling millions from Trenton\u2019s premier assisted-living facility, has mysteriously vanished from the hospital after an emergency appendectomy. Now it\u2019s on Stephanie to track down the con man. Unfortunately, Cubbin has disappeared without a trace, a witness, or his money-hungry wife. Rumors are stirring that he must have had help with the daring escape . . . or that maybe he never made it out of his room alive. Since the hospital staff\u2019s lips seem to be tighter than the security, and it\u2019s hard for Stephanie to blend in to assisted living, Stephanie\u2019s Grandma Mazur goes in undercover. But when a second felon goes missing from the same hospital, Stephanie is forced into working side by side with Trenton\u2019s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, in order to crack the case.<br><br>The real problem is, no Cubbin also means no way to pay the rent. Desperate for money\u2014or maybe just desperate\u2014Stephanie accepts a secondary job guarding her secretive and mouthwatering mentor Ranger from a deadly Special Forces adversary. While Stephanie is notorious for finding trouble, she may have found a little more than she bargained for this time around. Then again\u2014a little food poisoning, some threatening notes, and a bridesmaid\u2019s dress with an excess of taffeta never killed anyone . . . or did they? If Stephanie Plum wants to bring in a paycheck, she\u2019ll have to remember: No guts, no glory. . . .</p><h3>Review</h3><p>'Non-stop laughs with plenty of high jinks' -- USA Today 'A laugh-out-loud page-turner' -- Heat 'Pithy, witty and fast-paced' -- The Sunday Times </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p><strong>Janet Evanovich </strong>is the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum series, the Lizzy and Diesel series, twelve romance novels, the Alexandra Barnaby novels and Troublemaker graphic novels, and <em>How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author</em>. </p></div>"
