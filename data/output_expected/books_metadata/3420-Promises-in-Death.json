  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: **#1 *New York Times*\u2013 bestselling author J. D. Robb takes us to the New York City of 2060, where Lieutenant Eve Dallas faces down a cop killer.** A Amarylis Coltraine may have recently transferred to the New York City police force from Atlanta, but she\u2019s been a cop long enough to know how to defend herself against an assailant. When she\u2019s taken down just steps away from her apartment, killed with her own weapon, for Eve the victim isn\u2019t just \u201cone of us.\u201d Dallas\u2019s friend Chief Medical Examiner Morris and Coltraine had started a serious relationship, and from all accounts the two were headed for a happy future together. But someone has put an end to all that. After breaking the news to Morris, Eve starts questioning everyone from Coltraine\u2019s squad, informants, and neighbors, while Eve\u2019s husband, Roarke, digs into computer data on Coltraine\u2019s life back in Atlanta. To their shock, they discover a connection between this case and their own painful, shadowy pasts. The truth will need to be uncovered one layer at a time, starting with the box that arrives at Cop Central addressed to Eve containing Coltraine\u2019s guns, badge, and a note from her killer: \u201cYou can have them back. Maybe someday soon, I\u2019ll be sending yours to somebody else.\u201d But Eve Dallas doesn\u2019t take too kindly to personal threats, and she is going to break this case, whatever it takes. And that\u2019s a promise."
