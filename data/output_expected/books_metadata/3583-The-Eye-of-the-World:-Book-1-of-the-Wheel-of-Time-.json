  "description": "<p>NOW A MAJOR TV SERIES ON PRIME VIDEO The first book in the No. 1 international bestselling Wheel of Time saga that inspired the TV series.  When she arrives in a small village in the Two Rivers, Moiraine discovers three young men, each of whom might be the long-awaited and reviled Chosen One, the Dragon Reborn. But she is not the only stranger new to the village, nor the only one searching. In a race against time and the agents of the Shadow, she must guide her charges through lands of myth and legend, toward allies both new and old, and into the footsteps of prophecy.  The Wheel of Time turns, and an epic adventure begins.
