Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences\u2014biographical, historical, and literary\u2014to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.Who has not laughed at the emperor\u2019s new clothes, thrilled to the song of the nightingale, or sympathized with the ugly duckling? In the 170 years since they first began to appear, Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s Fairy Tales have entranced and bewitched millions of readers, adults and children alike. Writing in the midst of a Europe-wide rebirth of national literature, Anderson broke new ground with his fairy tales in two important ways. First, he composed them in the vernacular, mimicking the language he used in telling them to children aloud. Second, he set his tales in his own land and time, giving rise to his loving descriptions of the Danish countryside. In contrast to such folklorists as the Brothers Grimm, Anderson\u2019s tales are grounded in the real and often focus on the significance of small or overlooked things. Here are all of Andersen\u2019s collected tales, many\u2014such as \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d \u201cThe Red Shoes,\u201d and \u201cThe Steadfast Tin Soldier\u201d\u2014still popular through modern adaptations, and others, including \u201cThe Flying Trunk\u201d and \u201cThe Most Incredible Thing,\u201d well worth rediscovering. Jack Zipes is professor of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota. A specialist in folklore and fairy tales, he has authored numerous books of criticism over the last thirty years and edited several major anthologies, including the Norton Anthology of Children\u2019s Literature (2005). Marte Hvam Hult holds a Ph.D. in Scandinavian languages and literatures from the University of Minnesota. She is the author of Framing a National Narrative: The Legend Collections of Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen and a forthcoming translation of Asbj\u00f8rnsen\u2019s Huldreeventyr."
