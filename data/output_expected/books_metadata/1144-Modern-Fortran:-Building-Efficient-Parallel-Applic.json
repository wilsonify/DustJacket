  "description": "<p>Modern Fortran teaches you to develop fast, efficient parallel applications using twenty-first-century Fortran. In this guide, you\u2019ll dive into Fortran by creating fun apps, including a tsunami simulator and a stock price analyzer. Filled with real-world use cases, insightful illustrations, and hands-on exercises, Modern Fortran helps you see this classic language in a whole new light.</p>\n\n<p>Summary Using Fortran, early and accurate forecasts for hurricanes and other major storms have saved thousands of lives. Better designs for ships, planes, and automobiles have made travel safer, more efficient, and less expensive than ever before. Using Fortran, low-level machine learning and deep learning libraries provide incredibly easy, fast, and insightful analysis of massive data. Fortran is an amazingly powerful and flexible programming language that forms the foundation of high performance computing for research, science, and industry. And it's come a long, long way since starting life on IBM mainframes in 1956. Modern Fortran is natively parallel, so it's uniquely suited for efficiently handling problems like complex simulations, long-range predictions, and ultra-precise designs. If you're working on tasks where speed, accuracy, and efficiency matter, it's time to discover\u2014or re-discover\u2014Fortran..  About the technology For over 60 years Fortran has been powering mission-critical scientific applications, and it isn't slowing down yet! Rock-solid reliability and new support for parallel programming make Fortran an essential language for next-generation high-performance computing. Simply put, the future is in parallel, and Fortran is already there. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.
