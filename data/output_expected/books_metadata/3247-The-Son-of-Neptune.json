  "description": "<div><p><strong>Percy is confused.</strong> When he awoke after his long sleep, he didn\u2019t know much more than his name. His brain-fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight. Somehow Percy managed to make it to the camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he had to continually kill monsters that, annoyingly, would not stay dead. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him.<br></p><p><strong>Hazel is supposed to be dead.</strong> When she lived before, she didn\u2019t do a very good job of it. When the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her \u201cgift\u201d for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn\u2019t say no. Now, because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. <br></p><p><strong>Frank is a klutz. </strong>His grandmother claims he is descended from ancient heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn\u2019t see it. He doesn\u2019t even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery\u2014although not good enough to help the Fifth Cohort win at war games. His big and bulky physique makes him feel like a clumsy ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely\u2014enough, even, to share the secret he holds close to his heart. <br></p><p>Beginning at the \u201cother\u201d camp for half-bloods and extending as far north as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment in the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all of whom are destined to play a part in the most important quest of all: the Prophecy of Seven. <br></p><p><strong>\u00a0</strong><br></p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> From the Roman demigod camp to the prison of Death himself, <em>The Son of Neptune</em> reunites readers with old friends and introduces them to a whole new cast of characters. The Roman camp is a far cry from Camp Half-Blood, but it\u2019s every bit as fascinating to explore. Our heroes battle up and down the West Coast with impossibly few days before disaster is unleashed, fighting new foes and finding new friends along the way. Some of the mysteries from <em>The Lost Hero</em> are solved, while others loom even larger. Rick Riordan is a master at balancing just the right amount of seriousness and levity in every situation, and his three teen narrators point out the strangeness of the iterations of ancient myths in the modern world with spot-on accuracy. With page-turning adventure, witty dialogue, and fun, fascinating characters, this second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series is a must-read for any fan of myths and fables. <em>--Malissa Kent</em><br></p><h3>Review</h3><p>Sure to become a classic </p></div>"
