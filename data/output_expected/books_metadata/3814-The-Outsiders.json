  "description": "<div><h3><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px; \">SUMMARY: </span></h3><h3><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 11px; \">According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser. </span></h3><p>This classic, written by S. E. Hinton when she was 16 years old, is as profound today as it was when it was first published in 1967.</p>\n\n</div>"
