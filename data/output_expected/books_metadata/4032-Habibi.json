  "description": "<div>\n<p>From the internationally acclaimed author of Blankets (\u201cA triumph for the genre.\u201d\u2014Library Journal), a highly anticipated new graphic novel.\u00a0Sprawling across an epic landscape of deserts,\u00a0harems, and modern industrial clutter, Habibi tells the tale of Dodola and Zam, refugee child slaves bound to each other by chance, by circumstance, and by the love that grows between them. We follow them as their lives unfold together and apart; as they struggle to make a place for themselves in a world (not unlike our own) fueled by fear, lust, and greed; and as they discover the extraordinary depth\u2014and frailty\u2014of their connection.\u00a0At once contemporary and timeless, Habibi gives us a love story of astounding resonance: a parable about our relationship to the natural world, the cultural divide between the first and third worlds, the common heritage of Christianity and Islam, and, most potently, the magic of storytelling. </p>\n<p>From the Hardcover edition.</p></div>"
