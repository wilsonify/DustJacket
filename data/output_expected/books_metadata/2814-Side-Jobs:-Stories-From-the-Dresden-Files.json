  "description": "<p>Meet Harry Dresden, Chicago\u2019s first (and only) Wizard P.I. Turns out the \u2018everyday\u2019 world is full of strange and magical things \u2014 and most of them don\u2019t play well with humans. That\u2019s where Harry comes in.  </p>\n<p>Harry Dresden is the best at what he does, despite tending to stumble from crisis to drama in his dealings with the supernatural world. Somehow he unfailingly manages to get on the wrong side of werewolf, fae and vampire alike. But that\u2019s where his own rather special powers come into play.  </p>\n<p>As well as ten short stories, this collection includes an all-new <em>Dresden Files</em> novella. These bite-sized tales are tremendously entertaining and will infect you with the need to explore more of Harry Dresden\u2019s world.  </p>\n<p>MAGIC - IT CAN GET A GUY KILLED.  </p>\n<p>Contents:<br />\n- <em>Restoration of Faith</em> (2002, www.jim-butcher.com)<br />\n- <em>Vignette</em> (2002, www.jim-butcher.com)<br />\n- <em>Something Borrowed</em> (2006, in <em>My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding</em> )<br />\n- <em>It\u2019s My Birthday Too</em> (2007, in <em>Many Bloody Returns</em> )<br />\n- <em>Heorot</em> (2007, in <em>My Big Fat Supernatural Honeymoon</em> )<br />\n- <em>Day Off</em> (2008, in <em>Blood Lite</em> )<br />\n- <em>Backup</em> (2008, originally published by Subterranean Press)<br />\n- <em>The Warrior</em> (2009, in <em>Mean Streets</em> )<br />\n- <em>Last Call</em> (2009, in <em>Strange Brew</em> )<br />\n- <em>Love Hurts</em> (2010, in <em>Songs of Love and Death</em> )<br />\n- <em>Aftermath</em> (2010)  </p>"
