  "description": "<div>\n<p>Paradise, Massachusetts, police chief Jesse Stone confronts a town\u2019s darkest secrets in the shocking new novel from the New York Times\u2013bestselling author and \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest mystery writer\u201d (The New York Sun). </p>\n<p>Things are getting strange in Paradise, Massachusetts. Police Chief Jesse Stone is called to the junior high school when reports of lewd conduct by the school\u2019s principal, Betsy Ingersoll, filter into the station. Ingersoll claims she was protecting the propriety of her students when she inspected each girl\u2019s undergarments in the locker room. Jesse would like nothing more than to see Ingersoll punished, but her high-powered attorney husband stands in the way. At the same time, the women of Paradise are faced with a threat to their sense of security with the emergence of a tormented voyeur, dubbed \u201cThe Night Hawk.\u201d Initially, he\u2019s content to peer through windows, but as times goes on, he becomes more reckless, forcing his victims to strip at gunpoint, then photographing them at their most vulnerable. And according to the notes he\u2019s sending to Jesse, he\u2019s not satisfied to stop there. It\u2019s up to Jesse to catch the Night Hawk, before it\u2019s too late.</p></div>"
