  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: The *Rant Limited Edition*** **is specially packaged in a one-piece preprinted case, printed black, with the title created in spot gloss; a 4-color slipcase that matches the original jacket of the trade book; a 1/8\" ribbon marker; a signed tip-in sheet, speckled edges; and an exclusive 1300-word \"Automotive Afterword\" entitled \"Recipes for Disasters\" which is not available in print anywhere but only in this limited edition. **\u201cLike most people I didn\u2019t meet Rant Casey until after he was dead. That\u2019s how it works for most celebrities: After they croak, their circle of friends just explodes\u2026\u201d***Rant* is the mind-bending new novel from Chuck Palahniuk, the literary provocateur responsible for such books as the generation-defining classic Fight Club and the pedal-to-the-metal horrorfest Haunted. It takes the form of an oral history of one Buster \u201cRant\u201d Casey, who may or may not be the most efficient serial killer of our time. **\u201cWhat \u2018Typhoid Mary\u2019 Mallon was to typhoid, what Gaetan Dugas was to AIDS, and Liu Jian Lun was to SARS, Buster Casey would become for rabies.\u201d **A high-school rebel who always wins (and a childhood murderer?), Rant Casey escapes from his small hometown of Middleton for the big city. He becomes the leader of an urban demolition derby called Party Crashing. On appointed nights participants recognize each other by such designated car markings as \u201cJust Married\u201d toothpaste graffiti and then stalk and crash into each other. Rant Casey will die a spectacular highway death after which his friends gather testimony needed to build an oral history of his short, violent life. Their collected anecdotes explore the possibility that his saliva caused a silent urban plague of rabies and that he found a way to escape the prison house of linear time\u2026**\u201cThe future you have, tomorrow, won\u2019t be the same future you had, yesterday.\u201d\u2013Rant Casey**Expect hilarity, horror, and blazing insight into the desperate and surreal contemporary human condition as only Chuck Palahniuk can deliver it. He's the postmillennial Jonathan Swift, the visionary to watch to learn what's\u2013uh-oh\u2013coming next."
