  "description": "<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><em>Bossypants</em> is short, messy, and impossibly funny (an apt description of the comedian herself). From her humble roots growing up in Pennsylvania to her days doing amateur improv in Chicago to her early sketches on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Fey gives us a fascinating glimpse behind the curtain of modern comedy with equal doses of wit, candor, and self-deprecation. Some of the funniest chapters feature the differences between male and female comedy writers (\"men urinate in cups\"), her cruise ship honeymoon (\"it\u2019s very <em>Poseidon Adventure</em>\"), and advice about breastfeeding (\"I had an obligation to my child to pretend to try\"). But the chaos of Fey\u2019s life is best detailed when she\u2019s dividing her efforts equally between rehearsing her Sarah Palin impression, trying to get Oprah to appear on <em>30 Rock</em>, and planning her daughter\u2019s Peter Pan-themed birthday. <em>Bossypants</em> gets to the heart of why Tina Fey remains universally adored: she embodies the hectic, too-many-things-to-juggle lifestyle we all have, but instead of complaining about it, she can just laugh it off. <em>--Kevin Nguyen</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p>Once in a generation a woman comes along who changes everything. Tina Fey is not that woman, but she met that woman once and acted weird around her.  </p><p>PRAISE FOR TINA FEY:  </p><p>\"You'd be really pretty if you lost weight.\" (<strong>College Boyfriend, 1990</strong> )  </p><p>\"Tina Fey is an ugly, pear-shaped, overrated troll.\" (<strong>The Internet</strong> )  </p><p>\"Mommy, where are my pretzels?\" (<strong>Tracy Morgan</strong> )  </p><p>ADVANCE PRAISE FOR <em>BOSSYPANTS</em>:  </p><p>\"I hope that's not really the cover.
