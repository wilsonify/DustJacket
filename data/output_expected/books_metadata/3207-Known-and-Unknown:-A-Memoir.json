  "description": "<h3>Review</h3><p>\"I would heartily recommend it. I don't think anybody could go buy a book written by anybody who has been more intimately involved, closer to power, for as many years, has been through as much, has known all of the power players as you have. It is amazing.\" <br />-Rush Limbaugh (interview transcript)/2/8/2001 </p><p>\"Readers might be appreciative to find themselves in possession of a serious memoir, more in keeping with the older Washington tradition of Dean Acheson or Henry Kissinger. As might the historians.\" <br />-Kimberly Strassel/_Wall Street Journal_/2/8/2011 </p><p>\"The battle is joined. After a long silence, Donald Rumsfeld opened both barrels Tuesday, releasing his memoir, <em>Known and Unknown</em> . Early leaks of the book's defiant take on his life, times, and conduct of the Iraq War drew howls from some of the targets of his score-settling...But Rumsfeld battles on, taking his unapologetic account to the public.\" <br />-John Barry/_Newsweek-The Daily Beast_/2/8/2011 </p><p>\"The book places the reader in Rumsfeld's chair and is a serious stab at telling the history of a consequential period in America through the eyes of one of its most consequential players. It will be an important addition to the history of our time.\" <br />-Peter Baker (_New York Times_ White House correspondent)/Foreign Policy/2/9/2011 </p><p>Rumsfeld \"describes the highs and lows of a long and dramatic career and discloses some behind the scenes details that may shock you.\" <br />-Sean Hannity (interview transcript)/2/9/2011 </p><p>\"_Known and Unknown_ is a meaty, well-written book that will be a primary source for historians...this power memoir deserves to be read with the care that went into writing it.\" <br />-Christopher Buckley/_Businessweek_/2/10/2011 </p><p>\"'Dismissive' is a word often used to describe Rumsfeld, but 'dismissive' perfectly describes his critics, who are unwilling or unable to re-examine their own assumptions in the light of new or overlooked information and fresh perspective provided by Rumsfeld, in his exceedingly well-documented work. With its hundreds of annotations and supplementary documents, Known and Unknown is a significant contribution to the historical record. It is, as Rumsfeld once noted about similar memoirs, 'only from one perspective,' but it's a unique and valuable perspective, a serious work that deserves consideration by any serious student of recent history.\" <br />-Jamie McIntyre (former CNN Pentagon correspondent)/Line of Departure/2/10/2011 </p><p>\"It is a terrific book...Let me tell you something, it is absolutely fascinating. He's very blunt in talking about people and issues and so forth, you'll really enjoy it, in my humble opinion.\" <br />-Mark Levin (interview transcript)/2/10/2011 </p><h3>Product Description</h3><p>\"If you are not criticized, you may not be doing much.\" - Rumsfeld's Rules </p><p>Few Americans have spent more time near the center of power than Donald Rumsfeld. Now he has written an unflinching memoir of his half-century career, sharing previously undisclosed details that will fascinate readers and force historians to rethink many controversies. </p><p>Starting from a middle-class childhood in Illinois, Rumsfeld had a rapid rise that won him early acclaim. He shows us what it was like growing up during the Great Depression and World War II, going to Princeton on scholarships, serving as a naval aviator, then getting his first political job on Capitol Hill during the Eisenhower administration. He recalls how he won a seat in the House of Representatives at age thirty and what he experienced as a Republican in Congress during the Kennedy and Johnson years. </p><p>We also follow him back to the executive branch as he took on key cabinet positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations, including his service as the youngest-ever secretary of defense, just after the trauma of Vietnam. And we learn about the challenges he later faced as a CEO in the private sector, and during his special assignments for President Reagan, including a face-to-face meeting with Saddam Hussein in 1983. </p><p>All of that would have been enough material for a fascinating book. But as 2001 began, Rumsfeld's greatest challenges lay ahead of him. At age sixty-eight he returned to the Pentagon as President Bush's secretary of defense, with a mandate to transform the military for a new century. Just nine months later he would confront the worst acts of terrorism in American history, followed by unexpected wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he would be on the firing line for many controversies, from the revelations of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to allegations of torture at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p><p><em>Known and Unknown</em> reveals what happened behind the scenes during the critical moments of the Bush years, as the President's inner circle debated how best to defend our country. It is based not only on Rumsfeld's memory but also on hundreds of previously unreleased documents from throughout his career. It also features his blunt, firsthand opinions about some of the world's best-known figures, from Margaret Thatcher to Elvis Presley, from Henry Kissinger to Colin Powell, and about each American president from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George W. Bush. </p><p>In a famous press briefing, Rumsfeld once remarked that \"there are also unknown unknowns . . . things we do not know we don't know.\" His book makes us realize just how much we didn't know. </p><p>Donald Rumsfeld is donating his proceeds from the sales of <em>Known and Unknown</em> to the military charities supported by the Rumsfeld Foundation. </p>"
