  "description": "<div><h3>Review</h3><p>\"[James Agee's words] are so indelibly etched someplace inside of me that I couldn't reach to rub them out even if I wanted to. And I never want to.\" <br>-Steve Earle, from the Introduction <br></p><p>\"The work of a writer whose power with English words can make you gasp.\" <br>-Alfred Kazin, \"The New York Times Book Review\"<br></p><p>\" It is, in the full sense, poetry. . . . The language of the book, at once luminous and discreet . . . remains in the mind.\"<br>-\"The New Republic\"<br></p><p>\" Wonderfully alive.\" <br>-\"The New Yorker\" </p><h3>From the Publisher</h3><p>James Agee's Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>A Death In The Family</em> is the powerful, moving story of a universal human situation. It tells of a loving and closely-knit family--and of their great courage when tragedy changes senselessly and suddenly the lives of those who are left behind.</p><p>\"Maturely and masterfully, Agee accomplished a book which touches one deeply and which no reader will forget.\" -- <em>New York Herald Tribune Book Review</em></p></div>"
