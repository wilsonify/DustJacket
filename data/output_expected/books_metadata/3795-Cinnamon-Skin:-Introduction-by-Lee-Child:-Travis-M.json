  "description": "<p>'MacDonald had a huge influence on me . . . Reacher is like a fully detached version of Travis McGee' LEE CHILD Travis McGee isn\u2019t your typical knight in shining armour. He only works when his cash runs out, and his rule is simple: He\u2019ll help you find whatever was taken from you, as long as he can keep half. In the Florida Keys, a houseboat explodes in a giant white flash, instantly killing those on board. The boat belonged to Travis McGee\u2019s friend Meyer. But it\u2019s not Meyer who\u2019s dead \u2013 he\u2019d lent it to his just-married niece, Norma, and her husband, hoping to give them the perfect honeymoon. When a group of Colombian terrorists take responsibility for the brutal act, Meyer and McGee travel to Mexico to seek justice. And Meyer, normally content in McGee\u2019s shadow, is determined to avenge the one family member he had left . . . or die trying.
