  "description": "<p>Deploy deep learning applications into production across multiple platforms. You will work on computer vision applications that use the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model and Python. This book starts by explaining the traditional machine-learning pipeline, where you will analyze an image dataset. Along the way you will cover artificial neural networks (ANNs), building one from scratch in Python, before optimizing it using genetic algorithms. For automating the process, the book highlights the limitations of traditional hand-crafted features for computer vision and why the CNN deep-learning model is the state-of-art solution. CNNs are discussed from scratch to demonstrate how they are different and more efficient than the fully connected ANN (FCNN). You will implement a CNN in Python to give you a full understanding of the model.</p>\n\n<p>After consolidating the basics, you will use TensorFlow to build a practical image-recognition model that you will deploy to a web server using Flask, making it accessible over the Internet. Using Kivy and NumPy, you will create cross-platform data science applications with low overheads.</p>\n\n<p>This book will help you apply deep learning and computer vision concepts from scratch, step-by-step from conception to production. What You Will Learn Understand how ANNs and CNNs work Create computer vision applications and CNNs from scratch using PythonFollow a deep learning project from conception to production using TensorFlowUse NumPy with Kivy to build cross-platform data science applicationsWho This Book Is ForData scientists, machine learning and deep learning engineers, software developers.</p>"
