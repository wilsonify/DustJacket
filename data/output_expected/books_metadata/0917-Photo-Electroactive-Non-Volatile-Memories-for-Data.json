  "description": "<div>\n<p>Photo-Electroactive Non-Volatile Memories for Data Storage and Neuromorphic Computing summarizes advances in the development of photo-electroactive memories and neuromorphic computing systems, suggests possible solutions to the challenges of device design, and evaluates the prospects for commercial applications. Sections covers developments in electro-photoactive memory, and photonic neuromorphic and in-memory computing, including discussions on design concepts, operation principles and basic storage mechanism of optoelectronic memory devices, potential materials from organic molecules, semiconductor quantum dots to two-dimensional materials with desirable electrical and optical properties, device challenges, and possible strategies. This comprehensive, accessible and up-to-date book will be of particular interest to graduate students and researchers in solid-state electronics. It is an invaluable systematic introduction to the memory characteristics, operation principles and storage mechanisms of the latest reported electro-photoactive memory devices. - Reviews the most promising materials to enable emerging computing memory and data storage devices, including one- and two-dimensional materials, metal oxides, semiconductors, organic materials, and more - Discusses fundamental mechanisms and design strategies for two- and three-terminal device structures - Addresses device challenges and strategies to enable translation of optical and optoelectronic technologies</p></div>"
