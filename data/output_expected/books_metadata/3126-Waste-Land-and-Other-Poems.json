  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW: \"April is the cruelist month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain.\" This is the first line of T. S. Eliot's most famous poem, \"Wasteland\". His next offering, \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" repeats, \"In the room the women come and go talking of Michelangelo.\" The other poems are as haunting, if not as famous."
