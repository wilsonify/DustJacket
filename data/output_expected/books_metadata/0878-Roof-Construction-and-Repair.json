  "description": "<div>\n<p>Written by a traditional roofer during the Second World War, this reprint of the 1945 edition presents useful step by step guidance on the right techniques for laying and repairing roofs. It highlights the options for repairing damage rather than stripping and relaying the roof. The first four chapters describe the timber construction of roofs covering everything from basic joints through to the differences in the design of traditional and trussed roofs. It also provides extensive practical information of the design of pitched and flat roofs, jointing around roof lanterns, fixing lay boards up the pitch of the roofs and the setting out of steps in horizontal gutters. The following chapters describe slates and slating, tiling, wood and asphalt shingles, diamond slating and fibre cement slating.</p></div>"
