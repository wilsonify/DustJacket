  "description": "<p>In August 1914 the ENDURANCE set sail for the South Atlantic. The object of the expedition, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, was to cross the Antarctic overland. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their intended base, the ship was trapped, then crushed in the ice. For five months Shackleton and his men, drifting on ice packs, were castaways in one of the most savage regions of the world. Alfred Lansing's narrative, based on first hand accounts of those involved, describes how the men survived - after a long voyage in an open boat across the stormiest ocean on the globe and an overland trek through forbidding glaciers and mountains.</p>"
