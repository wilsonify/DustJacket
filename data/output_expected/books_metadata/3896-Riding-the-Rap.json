  "description": "<p>\u201cWicked and irresistible\u2026.Elmore Leonard is a literary genius.\u201d \u2014New York Times Book ReviewBefore U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens began electrifying TV viewers across America (in the hit series Justified), he \u201cstarred\u201d in Elmore Leonard\u2019s Riding the Rap\u2014an explosive, twisty tale of a brazen Florida kidnap caper gone outrageously wrong. Chock full of wildly eccentric and deliciously criminal characters\u2014including a psycho enforcer with a green thumb, a Bahamian bad man, and the beautiful, unabashedly greedy psychic Reverend Dawn\u2014Riding the Rap dazzles with Leonard\u2019s trademark ingenious plot turns and razor-keen dialogue. Gripping, surprising, and unforgettable, it is a crime fiction gem that any thriller writer\u2014from past masters John D. MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, and James M. Cain to the bestselling mystery auteurs of today\u2014would be thrilled to call his own.</p>"
