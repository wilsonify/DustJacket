  "description": "<p>National Book Award Finalist \u2022 Here is the unforgettable story of the Binewskis, a circus-geek family whose matriarch and patriarch have bred their own exhibit of human oddities\u2014with the help of amphetamines, arsenic, and radioisotopes. One of\u00a0The Atlantic\u2019s Great American Novels of the Past 100 YearsTheir offspring include Arturo the Aquaboy, who has flippers for limbs and a megalomaniac ambition worthy of Genghis Khan . . . Iphy and Elly, the lissome Siamese twins . . . albino hunchback Oly, and the outwardly normal Chick, whose mysterious gifts make him the family\u2019s most precious\u2014and dangerous\u2014asset.\u00a0 As the Binewskis take their act across the backwaters of the U.S., inspiring fanatical devotion and murderous revulsion; as its members conduct their own Machiavellian version of sibling rivalry, Geek Love throws its sulfurous light on our notions of the freakish and the normal, the beautiful and the ugly, the holy and the obscene. Family values will never be the same.</p>"
