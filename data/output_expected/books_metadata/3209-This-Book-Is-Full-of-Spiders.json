  "description": "<p>Fan favorite David Wong takes readers to a whole\u00a0new level with this blistering\u00a0sequel to the cult\u00a0sensation\u00a0<em>John Dies at the End,</em> soon to be\u00a0a movie starring Paul Giamatti</p><p>Originally released as an online serial where it\u00a0received\u00a0more than 70,000 downloads,\u00a0<em>John Dies at the End</em> has been described as a\u00a0\"Horrortacular\", an epic of \"spectacular\" horror that combines the laugh out loud humor of the best R-rated comedy, with the darkest terror of H.P. Lovecraft. The book went on to sell an additional\u00a060,000 copies in all formats.</p><p>As the\u00a0sequel opens, we find our heroes, David and John, again embroiled in a series of horrifying yet mind-bogglingly ridiculous events caused primarily by their own gross incompetence. The guys find that books and movies about zombies may have triggered a zombie apocalypse, despite a complete lack of zombies in the world. As they race against the clock to protect humanity from its own paranoia, they must ask themselves, who are the real monsters? Actually, that would be the shape-shifting horrors secretly taking over the world behind the scenes that, in the end, make John and Dave kind of wish it had been zombies after all.\u00a0</p><p>Hilarious, terrifying, engaging and wrenching, <em>This Book Is Full of Spiders,</em> the next thrilling installment, takes us for a wild ride with two slackers from the midwest who really have better things to do with their time than prevent the apocalypse.\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>Wong\u2014in reality Cracked.com writer Jason Pargin\u2014follows up his comic horror novel John Dies at the End (2009) with this wildly out-there sequel. Best friends John and Dave live in a smallish town that seems to suffer from a surfeit of supernatural and suspicious events. The story begins with a local cop being, um, intruded upon by a spiderish creature that turns its victim into, um, a zombie-like individual, and it gets a whole lot weirder from there. Wong, the book\u2019s first-person narrator and also one of its central characters (John being \u201cJohn Cheese,\u201d a fellow Cracked.com contributor) focuses mainly on the laughs and the strange goings-on, but there\u2019s a very interesting idea here: What if the current pop-culture zombie mania could lead to a pseudo-zombie apocalypse? What if, in other words, enough people believe in something to turn it into reality? And how do a couple of slacker dudes defeat a creature that, technically, doesn\u2019t even exist? Full of laughs and goofiness, the book should definitely appeal to fans of John Dies at the End and to readers of comic horror fiction in general (especially, it should be noted, fans of British novelist Tom Holt, who will be familiar with the same sort of whimsy and ordinary-guy-in-extraordinary-situation environment.) --David Pitt </p><h3>Review</h3><p>Praise for <em>This Book is Full of Spiders</em>:<br /></p><p>\u201cKevin Smith's Clerks meets H.P. Lovecraft in this exceptional thriller that makes zombies relevant again\u2026 From the dialogue to the descriptions, lines are delivered with faultless timing and wit. Wong never has to reach for comedy, it flows naturally with nary a stumble\u2026 the most pertinent story of the genre since George Romero's <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>\u2026 a tighter, more concentrated read than <em>John Dies at the End</em>\u2026 David Wong (Jason Pargin) is a fantastic author with a supernatural talent for humor. If you want a poignant, laugh-out-loud funny, disturbing, ridiculous, self-aware, socially relevant horror novel than <em>This Book is Full of Spiders: Seriously Dude, Don't Touch It</em> is the one and only book for you.\u201d \u2013SF Signal</p><p>\u201cThe comedic and crackling dialogue also brings a whimsical flair to the story, making it seem like an episode of AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d written by Douglas Adams of \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.\u201d \u2026Imagine a mentally ill narrator describing the zombie apocalypse while drunk, and the end result is unlike any other book of the genre.\u00a0 Seriously, dude, touch it and read it.\u201d \u2013<em>Washington Post</em></p><p>\u201c[A] phantasmagoria of horror, humor--and even insight into the nature of paranoia, perception, and identity.\u201d \u2013<em>Publishers Weekly,</em> starred review</p><p>\u201cViolence, soy sauce and zombie survivalists abound in this clever and funny sequel to <em>John Dies at the End</em> (2009).\u00a0 One of the great things about discovering new writers, especially in the narrow range of hybrid-genre comedic novels, is realizing that they\u2019re having just as much fun making this stuff up as you are reading it. Sitting squarely with the likes of S.G. Browne and Christopher Moore, the pseudonymous Wong (Cracked editor Jason Pargin) must be pissing himself laughing at his own writing, even as he\u2019s giving fans an even funnier, tighter and justifiably insane entry in the series.\u2026 The humor here is unforced and good-naturedly gory. Anyone who enjoyed the recent films <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em> or <em>Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil</em> will find themselves right at home. An upcoming (cult?) film adaptation of <em>John Dies at the End</em> promises to lure new readers.\u00a0 A joyful return to the paroxysms of laughter lurking in the American Midwest.\u201d \u2013<em>Kirkus</em></p><p>Praise for *John Dies at the End <br /></p><p><em>\"The rare genre novel that manages to keep its sense of humor strong without ever diminishing the scares; David is a consistently hilarious narrator whose one-liners and running commentary are sincere in a way that makes the horrors he confronts even more unsettling.\" --</em>The Onion AV Club <br /><em><br />\"</em>John Dies at the End<em> is like an H.P. Lovecraft tale if Lovecraft were into poop and fart jokes.\" \u2013</em>Fangoria <br /></p><p><em>\u201cSure to please the </em>Fangoria<em>\u00a0 set while appealing to a wider audience, the book's smart take on fear manages to tap into readers' existential dread on one page, then have them laughing the next.\u201d \u2013</em>Publishers Weekly <br /></p><p><em>\u201c\u2026strikes enough of a balance between hilarity, horror, and surrealism here to keep anyone glued to the story.\u201d \u2013</em>Booklist <br /></p><p><em>\"A loopy buddy-movie of a book with deadpan humor and great turns of phrase...Just plain fun.\" --</em>Library Journal <br /></p><p>*\u201cYou can (and will want to) read JOHN DIES AT THE END in one sitting.\u201d \u2013BookReporter.com<br /></p><p>\u201cWong blends horror and suspense with comedy\u2014a tricky combination\u2014and pulls it off effortlessly.\u201d \u2013FashionAddict.com<br /></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, compelling, engaging, arresting and--yes--sometimes even horrifying. And when it\u2019s not being any of those things, it\u2019s funny. Very, very funny.\u201d \u2013January Magazine<br /></p><p>\u201cThis is one of the most entertaining and addictive novels I\u2019ve ever read.\u201d \u2013Jacob Kier, publisher, Permuted Press<br /></p>"
