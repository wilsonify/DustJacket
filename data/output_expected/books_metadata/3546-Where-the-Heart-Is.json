  "description": "<div><p class=\"description\">SUMMARY:</p><p class=\"description\">When Novalee Nation is dumped in the small town of Sequoyah, Oklahoma, by her boyfriend Willie Jack, she can't believe her bad luck is coincidental. Seventeen years old, seven months pregnant and thirty-seven pounds overweight, Novalee is superstitious about the number seven, ever since her mother ran away on her seventh birthday with a baseball umpire named Fred. Fortunately for Novalee, the local Wal-Mart provides a meeting place for most of Sequoyah and Novalee quickly meets three eccentric characters who are to change her life: the blue-haired Sister Thelma Hudson, who hands out photocopied bibles, Benny Goodluck, a young Native American boy, and Moses Whitecotton, a black, elderly photographer who is eager to share all he knows. However, Novalee is determined to depend on nobody but herself, and with only ten dollars to her name she secretly lives in the Wal-Mart at night. It isn't until she goes into labour at the end of closing one day that she learns that sometimes it's not so bad to depend on the kindness of strangers. </p><p class=\"description\">WHERE THE HEART IS introduces an unforgettable and endearing heroine. Funny, fresh and endearing, it will make you laugh and cry.</p></div>"
