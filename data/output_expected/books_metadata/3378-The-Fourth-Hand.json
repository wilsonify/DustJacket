  "description": "<div><p><strong>The Fourth Hand</strong><em> </em>asks an interesting question: \u201cHow can anyone identify a dream of the future?\u201d The answer: \u201cDestiny is not imaginable, except in dreams or to those in love.\"<br></p><p>While reporting a story from India, a New York television journalist has his left hand eaten by a lion; millions of TV viewers witness the accident. In Boston, a renowned hand surgeon awaits the opportunity to perform the nation\u2019s first hand transplant; meanwhile, in the distracting aftermath of an acrimonious divorce, the surgeon is seduced by his housekeeper. A married woman in Wisconsin wants to give the one-handed reporter her husband\u2019s left hand \u2013 that is, after her husband dies. But the husband is alive, relatively young, and healthy.<br></p><p>This is how John Irving\u2019s tenth novel begins; it seems, at first, to be a comedy, perhaps a satire, almost certainly a sexual farce. Yet, in the end, <strong>The Fourth Hand</strong> is as realistic and emotionally moving as any of Mr. Irving\u2019s previous novels \u2013 including <strong>The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany</strong>, and <strong>A Widow for One Year</strong> \u2013 or his Oscar-winning screenplay of <strong>The Cider House Rules</strong>.<em><br></em></p><p><em>The Fourth Hand <em>is characteristic of John Irving\u2019s seamless storytelling and further explores some of the author\u2019s recurring themes \u2013 loss, grief, love as redemption. But this novel also breaks new ground; it offers a penetrating look at the power of second chances and the will to change.<br></em></em></p><p><em><em><em>From the Trade Paperback edition.</em></em></em></p><h3><em><em>Amazon.com Review</em></em></h3><p><em><em>Like anything newsworthy, miracles of medicine and technology inevitably make their way out of the headlines and become the stuff of fiction. In recent years readers have been absorbed by media accounts of a transplanted hand, an experiment that ultimately ended in amputation. Medical ethicists reason that a hand, unlike a heart or a liver--essential organs conveniently housed out of sight--is in full view and one of a pair, arguably dispensable. In his 10th novel, however, John Irving undertakes to imagine just such a transplant, which involves a donor, a recipient, a surgeon, a particular Green Bay Packer fan, and the remarkable left hand that brings them together.</em></em></p><p><em><em>Television reporter Patrick Wallingford becomes a story himself when he loses his hand to a caged lion while in India covering a circus. The moment is captured live on film, and Patrick (who wears a \"perpetual but dismaying smile--the look of someone who knows he's met you before but can't recall the exact occasion\") is henceforth known as the lion guy. Before long, plans are made to equip Patrick with a new hand. Doctor Nicholas M. Zajac, superstar surgeon, indefatigable dog-poop scooper, runner, and part-time father, is poised to perform the operation. But the donor--or rather the widow of the donor--has a few stipulations. Doris Clausen wants to meet the one-handed reporter before the procedure, and insists on visitation rights afterward. Irving weaves these characters and a panoply of others together in a smart, funny, readable narrative. Often farcical, <em>The Fourth Hand</em> is ultimately something more: a tender chronicle of the redemptive power of love. <em>--Victoria Jenkins</em></em></em></p><h3><em><em>From Publishers Weekly</em></em></h3><p><em><em>As the world watches, handsome TV journalist Patrick Wallingford, who is obsessed with minutely described one-night stands, has his hand eaten by a lion at the Gnesh Circus. (The gnesh is an Indian symbol of new beginnings). Viewer Doris and her husband Otto are obsessed with the Green Bay Packers and with having a child. Doris cajoles Otto into willing his left hand to Patrick and surprise! Otto soon (accidentally?) kills himself. Famous hand surgeon Nicholas Zajak is, for his part, obsessed with dog feces also described in endless detail which he scoops up with his old lacrosse stick and hurls at rowers on the Charles River. Zajak attaches Otto's hand to Patrick, and Doris demands visitation rights with Otto's hand, as well as with Patrick's child-producing equipment. Though their motivations remain unclear, all three characters are redeemed by their newfound obsessions with winning the love of their sons. Culp's clear, pleasant, middle-range reading voice, appropriately ironic tone and fun, exaggerated Boston accents are easy on the ears.
