  "description": "<p>Differentiated book- It has a historical context with research of the time-This book contains a historical context, where past events or the study and narration of these events are examined. The historical context refers to the circumstances and incidents surrounding an event. This context is formed by everything that, in some way, influences the event when it happens. A fact is always tied to its time: that is, to its time. Therefore, when analyzing events that took place tens, hundreds or thousands of years ago, it is essential to know the historical context to understand them. Otherwise, we would be analyzing and judging what happened in a totally different era with a current perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Henry Ernest Dudeney (April 10, 1857 - April 23, 1930) was an English author and mathematician specializing in logical puzzles and mathematical games. He is known as one of the country's leading mathematical puzzle creators.</p>\n\n<p>Dudeney was born in the town of Mayfield, East Sussex, England, one of the six children of Gilbert and Lucy Dudeney. His grandfather, John Dudeney, was known as a self-taught mathematician and pastor; His initiative was greatly admired by his grandson. Dudeney learned to play chess at an early age, and continued to play frequently throughout his life. This led to a marked interest in mathematics and puzzle composition. Chess problems in particular fascinated him during his early years.</p>\n\n<p>Although Dudeney spent his career in the Civil Service, he continued to brainstorm various problems and puzzles. Dudeney's first contributions were newspaper and magazine appearances</p>"
