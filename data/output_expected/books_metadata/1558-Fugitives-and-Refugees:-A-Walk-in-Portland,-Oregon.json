According to Katherine Dunn, author of the cult classic Geek Love, Portland is the home of America\u2019s \u201cfugitives and refugees.\u201d Get to know these folks, the \u201cmost cracked of the crackpots,\u201d as Palahniuk calls them, and come along with him on an adventure through the parts of Portland you might not otherwise believe actually exist. No other travel guide will give you this kind of access to \u201ca little history, a little legend, and a lot of friendly, sincere, fascinating people who maybe should\u2019ve kept their mouths shut.\u201dHere are strange personal museums, weird annual events, and ghost stories. Tour the tunnels under downtown Portland. Visit swingers\u2019 sex clubs, gay and straight. See Frances Gabe\u2019s famous 1940s Self-Cleaning House. Look into strange local customs like the I-Tit-a-Rod Race and the Santa Rampage. Learn how to talk like a local in a quick vocabulary lesson. Get to know, I mean really get to know, the animals at the Portland zoo. Oh, the list goes on and on.</p>"
