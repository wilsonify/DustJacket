  "description": "<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Welcome back to the Trojan War gone round the bend. Hector and Achilles have joined forces against the Olympic Gods. Back on a future Earth, assorted creatures from Shakespeare's __ get ready to rumble in a winner-takes-the-universe battle royale. And amid it all, a group of confused mere mortals with their classically trained robot allies (from Jupiter no less) race across time and space to keep from getting squashed as the various Titans of the Western Canon square off.</p><p>Confused? It's all part of Dan Simmons's <em>Olympos</em>, a novel one part fun-with-quantum-physics and two parts through-the-looking-glass survey of Western Literature. Picking up where he left off in the high-wire act __, Simmons doesn't disappoint. Not only is <em>Olympos</em> excellent hard science fiction and grand space opera, it's a riveting and fast-paced book that is alternately shocking, thrilling, and often deftly hilarious as his hapless human creations wrestle the forces of literary history itself. Be sure to read <em>Ilium</em> first though. That and a more-than passing familiarity with <em>_ might come in handy for the journey to Mars, Ilium's far-off shores, and the Earth that might be. --</em>Jeremy Pugh_</p><p><strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong></p><p><strong><em>Master of the Universes</em>: An Exclusive Interview with Dan Simmons</strong> </p><p><em>Olympos</em>, a tale of Mars, the Greek gods, and survival in a post-human world.</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p><em>Starred Review.</em> Drawing from Homer's <em>Iliad</em>, Shakespeare's <em>Tempest</em> and the work of several 19th-century poets, Simmons achieves another triumph in this majestic, if convoluted, sequel to his much-praised <em>Ilium</em> (2003). Posthumans masquerading as the Greek gods and living on Mars travel back and forth through time and alternate universes to interfere in the real Trojan War, employing a resurrected late 20th-century classics professor, Thomas Hockenberry, as their tool. Meanwhile, the last remaining old-style human beings on a far-future Earth must struggle for survival against a variety of hostile forces. Superhuman entities with names like Prospero, Caliban and Ariel lay complex plots, using human beings as game pieces. From the outer solar system, an advanced race of semiorganic Artificial Intelligences, called moravecs, observe Earth and Mars in consternation, trying to make sense of the situation, hoping to shift the balance of power before out-of-control quantum forces destroy everything. This is powerful stuff, rich in both high-tech sense of wonder and literary allusions, but Simmons is in complete control of his material as half a dozen baroque plot lines smoothly converge on a rousing and highly satisfying conclusion. <br />Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
