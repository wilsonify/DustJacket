  "description": "EDITORIAL REVIEW:\n\n**The alien virus arrived on Earth just after World War II -- and the world was never the same. For those who become infected, there are two results: death, or transformation. And depending on the recipient, death is sometimes the preferable outcome. Only a few lucky ones become superhuman \"aces\" as a side effect of the virus; the rest are turned into horrible, grotesque \"jokers.\" It's a strange and wonderful, terrible and terrifying world where anything can go. A world that, in a twist of fate, could lie just outside your door. ** \n\n A world of Wild Cards."
