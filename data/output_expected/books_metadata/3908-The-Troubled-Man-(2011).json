  "description": "<div class=\"blurb\">The much-anticipated return of Henning Mankell's brilliant, \nbrooding detective Kurt Wallander.<br><br>H\u00e5kan von Enke, a retired naval \nofficer, disappears during a walk in a forest near Stockholm. Wallander is not \nofficially involved in the investigation, but he is personally affected - von \nEnke is his daughter's father-in-law - and Wallander is soon interfering in \nmatters that are not his responsibility. He is confounded by the information he \nuncovers, which hints at elaborate Cold War espionage.<br><br>Wallander is also \nhaunted by his own past and desperate to live up to the hope that a new \ngranddaughter represents, and will soon come face-to-face with his most \nintractable adversary - himself.<br><br>Suspenseful, darkly atmospheric, \npsychologically gripping, <i>The Troubled Man</i> is certain to be celebrated by \nreaders and critics alike.</div>"
