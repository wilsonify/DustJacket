  "description": "<p>In the stories that make up Oblivion, David Foster Wallace joins the rawest, most naked humanity with the infinite involutions of self-consciousness -- a combination that is dazzlingly, uniquely his. These are worlds undreamt of by any other mind. Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father's desperate loneliness by way of his son's daydreaming through a teacher's homicidal breakdown (\"The Soul Is Not a Smithy\"). Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way (\"The Suffering Channel\"). Or capture the ache of love's breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring (\"Oblivion\"). Each of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate.</p>\n\n<p>\"Stunning...Wallace is an astonishing storyteller whose fiction reminds us why we learned to read in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>\" --San Francisco Chronicle</p>"
