  "description": "<p>Bernadette Fox is notorious. To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee, she is a best friend and, simply, Mom.<br /></p><p>Then Bernadette disappears. It began when Bee aced her report card and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle--and people in general--has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic.<br /></p><p>To find her mother, Bee compiles email messages, official documents, secret correspondence--creating a compulsively readable and touching novel about misplaced genius and a mother and daughter's role in an absurd world.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"Comedy heaven.... This divinely funny, many-faceted novel...leaves convention behind. Instead, it plays to Ms. Semple's strengths as someone who can practice ventriloquism in many voices, skip over the mundane and utterly refute the notion that mixed-media fiction is bloggy, slack or lazy.... The tightly constructed WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is written in many formats-e-mails, letters, F.B.I. documents, correspondence with a psychiatrist and even an emergency-room bill for a run-in between Bernadette and Audrey. Yet these pieces are strung together so wittily that Ms. Semple's storytelling is always front and center, in sharp focus. You could stop and pay attention to how apt each new format is, how rarely she repeats herself and how imaginatively she unveils every bit of information. But you would have to stop laughing first.\" (<strong>Janet Maslin, *The New York Times</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"You don't have to know Seattle to get Maria Semple's broadly satirical novel.... Underlying the nontraditional narrative are insights into the cost of thwarted creativity and the power of mother-daughter bonds, although a reader may be having too much fun to notice.\" (<strong><em>O, The Oprah Magazine</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"Delightfully droll.... Semple...cuts a wry slice of a life-one that's populated by private school helicopter parents, obsessively eco-conscious neighbors, and green-juice swilling, TED-talking husbands-and one that's sharp enough to make us feel slightly relieved about not having to live anywhere quite so bucolic.\" (<strong>Megan O'Grady, *Vogue</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"The characters in WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE may be in real emotional pain, but Semple has the wit and perspective and imagination to make their story hilarious. I tore through this book with heedless pleasure.\" (<strong>Jonathan Franzen, author of *Freedom</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"There's a lot to like in Semple's charming novel, including the vivacious humor and the lesson that when creative forces like Bernadette stop creating, they become 'a menace to society.' Even more appealing is the mutually adoring mother-daughter relationship at its warm heart.\" (<strong>Heller McAlpin, *NPR</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"In her second novel...Semple pieces together a modern-day comic caper full of heart and ingenuity....a compelling composite of a woman's life-and the way she's viewed by the many people who share it. As expected from a writer who has written episodes of <em>Arrested Development</em>, the nuances of mundane interactions are brilliantly captured, and the overarching mystery deepens with each page, until the thoroughly satisfying d\u00e9nouement.\" (<strong><em>Publisher's Weekly</em> (Starred Review)</strong> )<br /></p><p>\"A comedic delight...\" (<strong><em>Family Circle</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"Agoraphobia and Antarctica are among the elements in Maria Semple's terrific novel.\" (<strong><em>Parade</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"Semple's affecting characters, not-necessarily-nice humor and surprising plot twists make this novel an enchanting ride.\" (<strong>Carolyn Kellogg, *Los Angeles Times</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...Warm, dark, sad, funny-and a little bit screwball.... This is an inventive and very funny novel that gets bonus points for transcending form.\" (<strong>Susan Coll, *The Washington Post</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"[A] cracklingly smart family dramedy.... [I was] stunned and transported by this extraordinarily powerful and intelligent novel.\" (<strong>Lev Grossman, *Time</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Brilliant, hilarious, endlessly inventive, and compulsively readable, WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE grabs you by the collar and never lets go. Semple is not only a masterful juggler, and an astute social critic, she is a magician!\" (<strong>Jonathan Evison, author of *West of Here</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"A funny, quirky and wildly entertaining read.\" (<strong><em>Ladies' Home Journal</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE<em> </em>is a pure pleasure.... Semple's light touch and glittering prose keep things aloft.\" (<strong>Kate Tuttle, *The Boston Globe</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Full of endearing moments and sublime satire, WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is 'divinely funny' literature.\" (<strong><em>The Week</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"It was only a matter of time before Maria Semple turned her hilariously wicked, razor-sharp, acid-etched humor loose on Seattle, and set her impeccable laser sights on the heart of Microsoft. At times a tears-to-your-eyes laugher that skewers my own home town (and quite possibly my own mother), WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is also a compassionate look at family dysfunction, the paralysis of genius, and good old-fashioned parental love. Cleverly constructed and brilliantly executed, Semple has driven this one home with great authority, and has proven, once again, that she ranks among contemporary literature's finest satirists.\" (<strong>Garth Stein, author of *The Art of Racing in the Rain</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Find your patron saint of fed-up-ed-ness in our fave summer read, WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE.... You'll laugh your pants off, and love the takeaway-that a life gone off the rails can propel you in a bright new direction.\" (<strong><em>Redbook</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"If you read only one book this summer about an agoraphobic mother and her broken promise to take her daughter Bee on a trip to Antarctica, make it this one.... Semple writes like an oversized plume, finding all your tickle spots with ease.\" (<strong>Holley Simmons, *Washington Post Express</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...A smart, caperish, very contemporary novel about marriage, mores and family life by an observer who knows the cultural landscape.\"<br /></p><p>(<strong>Jeffrey Ann Goudie, *The Kansas City Star</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Achingly funny and perfectly timed....Semple has a big heart, and possess that rare ability to skewer, dissect and empathize with her targets, all at the same time....Read BERNADETTE, laugh loud and long, then take a good look in the mirror.\" (<strong>Mary Ann Gwinn, *Seattle Times</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"A delightfully funny book, that constantly catches one by surprise, WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE combines a shrewdly observed portrait of Seattle-life with, of all things, a mysterious disappearance in Antarctica. A pleasure.\" (<strong>Matthew Kneale, author of *When We Were Romans</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"If you're not taking a vacation this summer, a dive into Semple's comedic melting pot of family dysfunction, hyperactive parenting, and mental unraveling offers a hilarious escape. You'll find yourself rooting for the runaway parent in a narrative that is dark, funny, and completely human.\" (<strong>Tanya Jensen, *Los Angeles Confidential</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Sharp and funny, a literary page turner...\" (<strong>Susannah Cahalan, *New York Post</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Semple<em>...</em>has the feel for family strife of a born literary novelist, but she retains the comedic sensibility of a screen writer; which is to say that the book is actually laugh-out-loud funny, rather than \"humorous.\" And don't let the hilarity of the first third of the book fool you into thinking that this is a light farce; by the last page, Semple, in addition to skewering helicopter-parents with satire so deft that it could pass for truth, touches on religion, class, and what we owe to those we love.\" (<strong>Nicholas Mancusi, *The Daily Beast</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"An uproarious comedy of manners.\" (<strong>Mark Haddon, *People</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"This brilliant satire (think <em>Portlandia</em>, set in Seattle) is inventive and wickedly funny.\" (<strong><em>Whole Living</em></strong> )<br /></p><p>\"With a sure feel for the screwball and the slapstick, Maria Semple deliciously sends up the privileged, overachieving, PC world of Emerald City. WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is a crazy quilt of an epistolary novel, utterly contemporary yet pleasingly old-fashioned, and always light and witty.\" (<strong>Stewart O'Nan, author of* The Odds</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Semple's snappy writing and spot-on humor make this one of the funniest beach reads of the summer.\" (<strong>Meganne Fabrega, *Minneapolis Star Tribune</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"[A] high-energy, often hilarious epistolary novel.\" (<strong>Brangien Davis, *Seattle Magazine</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...A smart, intelligent, nuanced tale whose characters will stick with you long after you finish the last page.\" (<strong>Karen M. Thomas, *The Dallas Morning News</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Jonathan Franzen endorsed it...and we weren't aware that he liked anything, so we felt inclined to pick it up. We now see why he enjoyed it so much.\" (<strong>Zo\u00eb Triska, *Huffington Post</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Semple is the novelist of the moment-a Ben Fountain for the latte set....outrageously funny and deceptively deep, [BERNADETTE] is a rewarding read.\" (<strong>Tucker Shaw, *The Denver Post</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"With its big heart set on acceptance, BERNADETTE feels something like coming home.\" (<strong>Paul Constant, *The Stranger</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...A shrewd yet compassionate portrait of family dysfunction and the volatility of genius in laugh-out-loud, irresistibly high-spirited prose.... WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE<em> </em>takes readers on an original and movingly imaginative adventure.\" (<strong>Catherine Straut, *Elle</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Semple's ear for satirizing this world is sharp and scathingly funny; she could probably turn her novel into a stand-up act.\" (<strong>Stewart Oksenhorn, *The Aspen Times</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Semple, once a writer for <em>Arrested Development</em>, picks apart the mundane interactions of everyday life with a hilarious hand, and you're sure to be as swept up in this witty, inventive mystery as we were.\" (<strong>Emily Temple, *Flavorpill</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is fresh and funny and accomplished, but the best thing about it was that I never had any idea what was going to happen next. It was a wild ride...\" (<strong>Kate Atkinson, author of <em>Case Histories</em> and *Started Early, Took My Dog</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Maria Semple dissects the gory complexities of familial dysfunction with a deft and tender hand. WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is a triumph of social observation and black comedy by a skillful chronicler of moneyed malaise.\" (<strong>Patrick deWitt, author of *The Sisters Brothers</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"[An] engrossing and whip-smart modern epistolary novel...\" (<strong>Stephan Lee, *Entertainment Weekly</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Semple paints each character with depth and tenderness while keeping the tone upbeat; no easy feat for a novel about a mother who pulls a disappearing act.\" (<strong>Korina Lopez, *USA Today</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"[A] romp of a novel.... Semple...nail[s] Seattle's idiosyncrasies in wickedly funny send-ups.\" (<strong>Barbara Lloyd McMichael, *The Bellingham Herald</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...Utterly delightful....Semple used to write for the revered cult hit <em>Arrested Development</em>, and she brings plenty of squirming comedy to the novel, which manages to be that rare good read that actually makes you feel good at the end. Her send-up of Seattle is hilarious, with its Victims Against Victimhood support groups, moms offering organic gardeners swiss chard in lieu of payment, and teachers who are so PC that fourth graders are expected to seriously debate the pros and cons of the Chinese occupation of Tibet. But the heart of the book belongs to Bee, who, as an admissions counselor puts it, tests off the charts for grit and poise; and her mother, who, for all her neuroses, did a bang-up job of turning out one terrific kid.\" (<strong>Yvonne Zipp, *Christian Science Monitor</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...A quirky novel, laugh-out-loud funny in parts, filled with erudite cultural commentary, and teeming with life's predictable messiness, as well as its limitless potential for unexpected joy.\" (<strong>Kathryn Justice Leache, *The Commercial Appeal</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"A touching and hilarious portrait of the anxiety producing, high powered Seattle lifestyle of a somewhat eccentric family of three (and their dog Ice Cream).... This is a great read, well written and populated by characters you care about deeply.\" (<strong>Ruth Freeman, *The Norwalk Citizen</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Stands to become a cult favorite.... Like Jane Austen-who set the gold standard for social satire-Semple's most ridiculous characters are convinced that they're the normal ones, and it's wonderful fun to watch as they behave abominably, believing themselves blameless.... Semple has a keen ear for the nuances of different voices, and it's a joy to get to know these people.... Bernadette is...marvelous. Her rants read like the best comedy routines.... It's the rare book that actually deserves the term \"laugh-out-loud funny,\" but I found myself reading passages from almost every page to anyone who would listen, even as I could barely articulate the words through my own laughter.\" (<strong>Malena Watrous, *San Francisco Chronicle</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"Intertwined with the funny stuff is the heartfelt story of a personal crisis of a creative talent who's slipped off the rails... Bernadette's journey is fresh, funny, and thought provoking.\" (<strong>Anne Payne, *The Florida Times-Union</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...Comic lines and...fast-paced events.\" (<strong>Nan Willard Cappo, *The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"I don't even know where to begin with how fantastic it is.... I ate up the Microsoft-obsessed setting and the fabulous, mad-but-not-really Bernadette. Go, get it, thank me later.\" (<strong>Megan Angelo, *Glamour.com</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...If wacky, anxiety-prone geniuses are some of your favorite people, then pick up Maria Semple's WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE to add Bernadette Fox and her family to your list of hilarious companions. Bernadette and company don't mind cursing, so if you do, please be warned. But if not, then you've got a stamped passport to Semple's expertly crafted and rollicking, laugh-till-you-cry adventure that will have you tearing through the pages to find out if Bernadette is gone for good.\" (<strong>Dawn Andrus Paine, <em>Daily Herald </em>(Utah)</strong> )<br /></p><p>\"...Well-plotted and masterfully satirical.... WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is really, really funny, and not in the usual way that suggests the author is trying to be funny to cover up their deficiencies in plot or styling. As it turns out, Maria Semple is both a good writer and a funny writer, but she prefers to be the latter.\" (<strong>Janet Potter, *The Millions</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"...Sublime...\" (<strong>Frank Bruni, on his blog for *The New York Times</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"With only her second book, TV writer-turned novelist Maria Semple has won rave reviews with a withering, but ultimately affectionate satire of Seattle's privileged set.\" (<strong>Chris Michaud, *Reuters</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"If Gillian Flynn's <em>Gone Girl</em> represented the dark heart of the summer literature, Maria Semple's...BERNADETTE embodies the sunnier, funnier side.... Semple has a flair for satire and screwball jinks, and she has produced a great gift to avid readers: a book that you never want to finish reading.\" (<strong>Connie Ogle, *The Miami Herald</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"An epistolary novel for the twenty-first century.... Paced like a beach read, BERNADETTE<em> </em>has a scathing wit and a casual storytelling style that pulls the reader in and forces her to listen.\" (<strong><em>Capital Times' </em>blog</strong> )<br /></p><p>\"....A powerful mosaic of mental illness, artistic temperament, and family melodrama.... Semple's background in television and comedy... provide[s] the foundation for this subversively funny novel and its all-too-rare blend of humor and heart.... In a time when everything is a version of something else, how extraordinary-and exciting-to read a novel that subverts conventions to create an experience that feels so fresh.\" (<strong>Jeremy Medina, *The L Magazine</strong>* )<br /></p><p>\"This book is hysterical, kind of wacky, and utterly original.\" (<strong><em>Entertainment Weekly</em>'s \"The Bullseye\"</strong> )<br /></p><p>\"Semple's epistolary novel satirizes Seattle, Microsoft, helicopter parents, the elite, and the overeducated-while revealing truths about family, genius, ambition, and resilience.\" (<strong>Gillian Flynn, *GQ</strong>* ) </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p><strong>Maria Semple</strong>'s first novel, <em>This One is Mine</em>, was set in Los Angeles, where she also wrote for television shows including <em>Arrested Development</em>, <em>Mad About You</em>, and <em>Ellen</em>. She escaped from Los Angeles and lives with her family in Seattle, where her second novel takes place. </p>"
