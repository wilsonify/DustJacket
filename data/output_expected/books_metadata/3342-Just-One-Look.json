  "description": "<p>When Grace Lawson picks up a newly developed set of family photographs, she finds a picture from at least twenty years ago. In the photo are five people: four that she has never seen before and one who very much resembles her husband. Though he denies that he is the man in the photo, Jack drives away later on that night without an explanation, taking the photograph with him. In the days that follow, Grace tries to keep her family together, yet, each passing day brings only more unanswered questions. Realizing that there might be others looking for Jack, she goes to the police who refuse to help her. In order to keep her children safe, Grace must delve into the past and discover the truth - this taking her to a maximum security prison where a killer has an extraordinary secret to tell.</p>"
