  "description": "<p>Spanning a thousand years, and following the shifting fortunes of two families though the ages, this is the epic saga of Rome, the city and its people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weaving history, legend, and new archaeological discoveries into a spellbinding narrative, critically acclaimed novelist Steven Saylor gives new life to the drama of the city\u2019s first thousand years \u2014 from the founding of the city by the ill-fated twins Romulus and Remus, through Rome\u2019s astonishing ascent to become the capitol of the most powerful empire in history. Roma recounts the tragedy of the hero-traitor Coriolanus, the capture of the city by the Gauls, the invasion of Hannibal, the bitter political struggles of the patricians and plebeians, and the ultimate death of Rome\u2019s republic with the triumph, and assassination, of Julius Caesar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Witnessing this history, and sometimes playing key roles, are the descendents of two of Rome\u2019s first families, the Potitius and Pinarius clans:\u00a0 One is the confidant of Romulus. One is born a slave and tempts a Vestal virgin to break her vows. One becomes a mass murderer. And one\u00a0becomes the heir of Julius Caesar. Linking the generations is a mysterious talisman as ancient as the city itself.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Epic in every sense of the word, Roma is a panoramic historical saga and Saylor\u2019s finest achievement to date.</p>"
