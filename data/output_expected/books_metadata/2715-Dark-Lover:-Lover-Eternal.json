  "description": "<div>\n<p>Dark lover: In Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war going on between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other--six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood and the only purebred vampire left on earth, has a score to settle with the slayers who murdered his parents centuries ago. But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed--leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate--Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead, a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.</p></div>"
