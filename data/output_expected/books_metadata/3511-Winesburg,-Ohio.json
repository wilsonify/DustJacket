  "description": "<div><p>Winesburg, Ohio By Sherwood Anderson</p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Sherwood Anderson (1876-1941) was born in Camden, Ohio. Following a brief stint in the Spanish American War, he started a family and founded a business-both of which he abruptly abandoned at the age of thirty-six to pursue his life-long dream of writing. His simple and direct writing style, with which he portrayed important moments in the lives of his characters, influenced both Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner. His most notable works include Winesburg, Ohio, Triumph of the Egg, Horses and Men, and A Story Teller's Story. George K. Wilson has narrated over one hundred fiction and nonfiction audiobook titles, from Thomas L. Friedman to Thomas Pynchon, and has won several AudioFile Earphones Awards. He spent ten years in broadcast news, including for the American Forces Radio and Television Service and for rock radio in San Diego and Los Angeles. An American Academy of Dramatic Arts, West, graduate, his acting career includes stage, film, television, commercials, improvisational comedy, and stand-up. George has written and performed in over five hundred nationally syndicated short news satire features for public radio and NPR and has received a national Corporation for Public Broadcasting Gold Award for Best Public Service Program. He has also scripted and hosted corporate videos for Sony, Merck, IBM, and Price Waterhouse. He is currently working on a suspense short story collection and a thriller novel. </p></div>"
