  "description": "<div>\n<p>This title details the operation and application of logging tools and services, with emphasis on the physical sense of what each tool does and how it does it. The book provides current, comprehensive solutions for both traditional and new oilfield operations problems to practicing petroleum and petrophysical engineers. Cased Hole and Production Log Evaluation provides long-awaited information on the uses of cased hole logging tools in the following recovery/workover applications: formation evaluation through casing; mechanical integrity, cement bond evaluation, and casing inspection surveys; flow evaluation in production and injection wells.</p></div>"
