  "description": "SUMMARY: John Perry has at last found peace in a violent universe, living quietly with his family in one of humanity's many colonies. It's a good life, yet there's something . . . missing. When John and his wife Jane are asked to lead a new colony world, he jumps at the chance to explore the universe once more. But they soon find out that nothing is what it seems, for his new colony are merely pawns in an interstellar game of war and diplomacy between humanity's Colonial Union and a new, seemingly unstoppable alien alliance that is dedicated to ending all human colonization. As this contest rages above, Perry struggles to keep his terrified colonists alive in the face of threats both alien and familiar, on a planet yet to reveal its own fatal secrets. EDITORIAL REVIEW: They are the special wing of the Colonial Defence Forces, elite troops created from DNA of the dead and turned into the perfect soldiers for the CDF's toughest operations. The universe is a dangerous place for humanity, as three hostile races combine to halt our further expansion into space. Their linchpin is a turncoat scientist, Charles Boutin, who unfortunately knows the CDF's biggest military secrets. And to prevail against this alliance, they must find out why Boutin did what he did.Jared Dirac is the only human able to provide answers, being a superhuman hybrid created form Boutin's own DNA. Jared's brain should therefore be able to access Boutin's electronic memories ...but when that appears to fail, Jared is instead passed on to the Ghost Brigades. Then, just as time is running out, Boutin's memories slowly begin to surface within him...but all this while the enemy is planning something much worse for mankind than just military defeat. Praise for \"Old Man's War\": 'Clever dialogue, fast-paced story and strong characters.' - \"The Times\". 'An original idea, which is brilliantly executed' - \"Sc-Fi Now\"."
