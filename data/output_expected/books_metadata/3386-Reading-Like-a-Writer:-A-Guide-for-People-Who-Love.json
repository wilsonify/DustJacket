  "description": "<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p><em>Starred Review.</em> The trick to writing, Prose writes, is reading\u2014carefully, deliberately and slowly. While this might seem like a no-brainer, Prose (_Blue Angel_; <em>A Changed Man</em>) masterfully meditates on how quality reading informs great writing, which will warm the cold, jaded hearts of even the most frustrated, unappreciated and unpublished writers. Chapters treat the nuts and bolts of writing (words, sentences, paragraphs) as well as issues of craft (narration, character, dialogue), all of which Prose discusses using story or novel excerpts. This is where the book truly shines; Prose is remarkably egalitarian in choosing exemplars of fiction: David Gates, Denis Johnson, John le Carr\u00e9 and ZZ Packer, for instance, are considered as seriously as Chekhov, Melville, Flaubert or Babel. Prose insists that \"literature not only breaks the rules, but makes us realize that there <em>are none</em>,\" and urges writers to re-read the classics (Chekhov, especially) and view \"reading as something that might move or delight you.\" Prose's guide to reading and writing belongs on every writer's bookshelf alongside E.M. Forster's <em>Aspects of the Novel</em>. <em>(Aug.)</em> <br />Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Prose makes a superb application of that concept for readers of fiction. To know how the great writers create their magic, one needs to engage in a close reading of the masters, for that is precisely what successful writers have done for thousands of years. College programs in creative writing and summer workshops serve a purpose, but they can never replace a careful reading of the likes of Austen, Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Salinger, Tolstoy, and Woolf. In this excellent guide, Prose explains exactly what she means by close reading, drawing attention to the brick and mortar of outstanding narratives: words, sentences, paragraphs, character, dialogue, details, and more. In the process, she does no less than escort readers to a heightened level of appreciation of great literature. Many will want to go to the shelves to read again, or for the first time, the books she discusses. And to aid them, she thoughtfully adds a list at the end: Books to Be Read Immediately._\u2013Robert Saunderson, Berkeley Public Library, CA_ <br />Copyright \u00a9 Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
